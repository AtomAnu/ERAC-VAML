and of course , we share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> by death through death and so that we shouldn &apos;t surprise we all the singing , that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique <unk> <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
so , all of these people teach us that there are other people &apos;s brain on other ways of thinking other ways of being on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , you just get one with hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world are a web of <unk> and <unk> life that the earth <unk> and for that earth as well as the biological culture , which you know as biosphere .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species .
and just like the biosphere was strong , this was done with the <unk> -- just with more speed .
and the key thing is the <unk> languages .
when everyone was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet earth .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is found access to the physical world .
every language is like an <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , an ecosystem , spiritual opportunities .
and of these 6,000 languages today , today , as we sit here in monterey , that &apos;s exactly half of the children in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to be taught anymore . that means if nothing is going to be done , they actually already are dead .
what could be lonely is being silent , one of the last in your own people who talk to your language , not to have a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors to pass or to expect the hope ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and take the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you would realize , like , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you through a journey through the <unk> journey , a quick journey through the <unk> , to try to try to understand it , which is actually lost .
now there are some of us who are in some sense that i &apos;m saying , if i say , &quot; different ways of being my own . &quot;
for example , take this kid in the northwest of the amazon forest in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not desperate between the colors and the green blue , because the <unk> forest is the forest that affects people , <unk> .
you have a curious language , and a <unk> language called <unk> <unk> : you have to marry someone who is a different language .
so , all of these are the <unk> in the past , and the strange part of these large houses in which because of the <unk> six or seven languages , is that you never ever heard somebody who &apos;s learning a language .
they only hear and start talking .
or one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who first got the first one in the back in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> tried to absorb contact , and made a <unk> mistake .
they include <unk> photos of the air that we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen a difference in their lives in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that the <unk> of the devil .
but the <unk> weren &apos;t killing <unk> with the spear .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through <unk> .
but at the same time , she had a clear knowledge of forest forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell of the urine of the animal steps , and determine what animal animals were able to smell of it .
and to give you a sense of <unk> , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in the <unk> and <unk> is not a cult of black magic .
in fact , it &apos;s a kind of kind of kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to counted the large world of world leaders , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith . of course , there was a <unk> of this very deep religious idea , which is the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
but what makes the interesting difference is these live relationship between the living and the dead .
they give birth to the spirits number .
the ghosts can become <unk> by the large water , respond to rhythm to the rhythm of living , to <unk> the soul of the living .
<unk> say the <unk> , &quot; your white goes into church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take that spirit , how can you damage to you ?
so you see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal , <unk> <unk> , an amazing illustration of the ability of the spirit of mind to influence that this is <unk> <unk> when it comes to a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the kogi of the sierra nevada <unk> de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> civilization , which is the heart institute of the columbia dead , and in fact , in the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the people in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered <unk> .
so to the present day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , which is an education , but the <unk> is very extraordinary .
and over the course of the time , they are culturally in the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- balance .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they &apos;re the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , the destruction of the world &apos;s <unk> .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so , <unk> are neither <unk> , and they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
now , what does that mean ?
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this , like this plant .
it &apos;s a picture i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon northwest .
this is <unk> , from a lot of you , the most powerful <unk> compound from the repertoire of the <unk> .
this plant contains a few very strong <unk> of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , that substance that it contains this kind of substance that it contains as well .
this powder is about something like this <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be <unk> the reality of the reality , but the resolution of reality .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t take <unk> , because they &apos;re by one in the human gut enzyme enzyme .
you can only get into some other chemicals with some other chemicals that mao mao &apos;s <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> from the way that are necessary that are necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself .
so , how can these people come from a <unk> crowd of 80,000 plants that are carrying these two <unk> plants , which are that , if that combined , is creating a kind of <unk> version , that all the bigger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistake , which is meaningless .
but you say , you say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
these tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> that they all recognize at great distance in the forest as a form .
and then you ask them how they answered their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understood something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out , you know , you get 17 varieties of <unk> , and you &apos;re singing to one in a different <unk> .
well , that &apos;s not bringing you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
well , the <unk> problem is that even amongst us who have the <unk> of the very difficult state of native indigenous people to the very difficult state , they kind of look at the past , as a real world , as the real world , is accelerating our world .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> weren &apos;t listening to the sioux of the sioux , when they stopped <unk> and arrow as the americans stopped when americans stopped and <unk> tasks .
it &apos;s not change and technology will threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s a ugly face of domination .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i do a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of humans is widely convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of humans , isn &apos;t not convicted , but <unk> as part of a <unk> behavior .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering from that , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at <unk> stage .
the father of this young <unk> was the followers of the <unk> lama .
this meant that he was killed in the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle bug with his holiness in the diaspora to <unk> people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned , as punishment for -- to be wealthy to the crime .
he was in the age of two years of prison in the prison to hide under her <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live it without it .
the sister that was doing this brave <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
one day she came to a <unk> <unk> , and she had to <unk> them for seven years .
the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people &apos;s mind is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really are standing in front of a choice in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s very humbling to think that our species might exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us into agriculture , and at this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the priesthood , and hierarchy , specialization , created -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern world , as we know it is hardly any 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we have in the ensuing millennia to come across the city .
if we ask these <unk> , after the human being human , they talk to 10,000 different voices .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the <unk> when i was with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of our regime , they were forced to move in settlements .
the man of this old man refused refused .
the family , the fear of his life , had taken all the tools and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit were not afraid of the cold ; they used to use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> were originally made from fish that were wrapped in <unk> .
the man of man &apos;s husband was didn &apos;t really fear the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out , he made his pants out of <unk> and <unk> into his hand . and when the feces started freezing , he formed them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the side of the <unk> , and he was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took the skeleton of the dog , <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> on the ground .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the inuit , and all the native americans in the world .
the canadian government , in april 1999 , was the complete control over an area of 1999 , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new homeland and <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , a state that can look for their people and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who went to the distant goal of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination in the past times <unk> , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , how the dreams of our own lives are of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we think that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution to be in the world for storytelling in the world .
<unk> nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are being read by millions .
thank you .
we see a lot of , many <unk> of digital photos here , which you seamlessly have , and that &apos;s continuously <unk> , over the course of a way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many people are looking at how big these collections are or how big the pictures are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can affect the power of a system like this is the number of pixels on the screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a representation of the <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and this really gives you the pleasure of having a real good experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a <unk> of a bit of magnitude .
we also have done something about this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve created a wrong ad with very high resolution resolution , which is much higher than in a normal display , and we added content content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical impaired .
and this is actually going to take these ideas on the ground for the available point on the ground .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean any <unk> and other nonsense means that it means not necessary .
of course , that &apos;s a really obvious application for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
but these are all the streets in the <unk> .
<unk> up on top of the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s now take something else .
now that &apos;s live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects really two different technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which is a noah <unk> , a <unk> at the university of washington , among the <unk> of steve <unk> at the <unk> <unk> institute .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we can make these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through pictures and make this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial configuration of images is actually about it .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some things that are much more <unk> .
we had to worry about lawyers and so on .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the way in relation to one another .
and we can navigate with this very simple way .
and you know , i never thought i &apos;ll work at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : it &apos;s all about the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty big number of them that were all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of them are face by faces and so on .
there &apos;s a number of photographs here -- they &apos;re here .
this is actually a poster of the <unk> lady that was recorded right .
we can shift from a poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment -- it &apos;s now going to be collected data from all -- from all of the collective memories of what , like , visually the earth -- and everything will connect .
all these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s using the user to use the user with the use of the user .
your own photos are going to <unk> with soft <unk> , who has entered another person .
and of course , of course , all of this is the immense virtual models of every interesting part of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just a <unk> or satellite and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
am i going to get them right ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover .
if you want to make it <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of <unk> information that many of these pictures have .
how if you do a <unk> test for pictures where you enter sentences and in the website of the website , lots of information has a lot of information about what this image is .
but what if the picture is connected to all your images ?
and then the scope of <unk> <unk> and the abundance that make it that make it really is enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a few things about my book , and i &apos;m hoping to share with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections if you didn &apos;t notice them .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
what &apos;s the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works , if our goal is to maximize the <unk> of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the person .
the reason for this is freedom in itself is good , valuable , good , a <unk> premise for human beings .
if people have freedom , then each of us for themselves to do things that can maximize our good news , and no one has to choose to decide .
so the way maximize freedom to maximize is to maximize .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
and this is , i think , deep in our water supply , that there &apos;s no way that it would come to mind it .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples of what makes us modern our progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store to a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , amplifier , and in that an electronics industry is so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> <unk> millions of different kinds of systems together , which are being offered in this building .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , when i was a boy , and you wanted to have the <unk> of the <unk> bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was never broken the phone .
these days are over .
we have now almost an infinite choice , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be going soon .
and what does it do to make people walk into the business and make this question .
now you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that &apos;s not too much doing .
in other aspects of life , the very much <unk> than that is to get objects , the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do it , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has got the benefits and risks .
what do they want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
there &apos;s enormous marketing marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , no sense of power , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they promote if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : they expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change in the prescription .
so , something like our identity is now a question of choice as a choice .
we don &apos;t inherit identity ; we invent it .
and we &apos;re often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and that almost every one had a little bit of how they could , and then they could get children as fast as they could .
the only choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , it &apos;s all simple .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and it &apos;s not because they are less carefully , not because they are very careful .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i only have children , or do the career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether this means all the work that i &apos;m going to do and not have good grade in my class .
and indeed , they should . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to be blessed by carl , which allows us to work every minute of every single day on the planet -- to work on the <unk> hotel .
so , by the way , there &apos;s actually a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about that <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making work , again and again , and again , we should be working , whether we should work or not work .
we can play a video of football game playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our own laptop is probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned off , every minute we &apos;re shut down to our child <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ?
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly <unk> your child &apos;s experience when it was .
everywhere we look , big things and small stuff , material things , is a matter of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there are some choices , but not everything was a choice of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , is the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to get what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
it &apos;s an effect , <unk> way , that it &apos;s <unk> instead .
with so many options you can choose , people are very difficult to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , which is a study of investment in volunteers .
one person who had access to me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of a million employees , about 2,000 jobs and about 2,000 jobs jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent <unk> that led to employers , took the participation in the participation .
they provide 50 percent of them -- 10 percent fewer staff than if they were only five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are going to be selection , it &apos;s so hard to choose which you should pick it up at tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never comes .
by participation , you can &apos;t spend up to 5,000 dollars a year on <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce in your contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s all the eternity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong thing .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we get that paralysis and meet a decision , we end up with less content with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to choose between less options .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more opportunities there are , the more simple it is , the easier to regret it is disappointing for the election .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point in this morning by telling us how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we &apos;re doing .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s just attractive to thinking about alternatives that you &apos;re aware of , that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives that they voted .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not in new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of things .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they &apos;ve got it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn it says , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the mind that he missed the opportunity day , day on day a lot of a lot .
<unk> <unk> goes down the satisfaction we get through our choice , as well as what we chose .
and the more opportunities for the selection , the more attractive properties of this sample are required in <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes a few statements .
it makes a statement about it now and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is always a matter of who you decide to do other things not to do .
and these other things like these other attractive animals , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less stable .
three : the expectation of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to share my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
so to buy new jeans after many years of old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; you want to <unk> , easily <unk> or a lot ?
do you want buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want holes with holes ?
you want to go far down far , <unk> , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my pine jaw was down after i recovered , i &apos;d like to say , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way the only species . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and tony &apos;s business -- and i tell the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better had it . all of these choices allowed me to do it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
and the reason that i felt worse was , with all these available opportunities , with all these available opportunities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans is .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have some concrete expectations as it was in a way .
and when they came perfectly in 100 ways , it &apos;s damn it .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i used to get in what i expected , and what i had was disappointing in compared was what i expected .
the adding of possibilities in human life increases the expectations of people about how well people will have these opportunities .
and this leads to less happiness , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> this is , because if you would , you know , you &apos;d all know what &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that we used to be better than anything was worse than anything that was worse than anything that was worse to do experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection , the best for you can ever hope to do things that are so good to you .
you &apos;re never going to get pleasant because your expectations , your expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;re all coming in -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i wouldn &apos;t have to do it better . i haven &apos;t <unk> myself .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you &apos;re the <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
and it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to ask .
you could have better do it better .
with 100 different kinds of <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
and so this is the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think about , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , this is a little more selection better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that , that &apos;s more selection .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that very long time where we &apos;ve missed this problem .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about thinking is , what all these choice is in the developed societies is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you , whose problem isn &apos;t the problem of choice .
your problem is you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is : steve <unk> has told them yesterday about it , and it &apos;s a waste of money , and it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they actually hurt .
it &apos;s how we &apos;re getting worse there .
if something about what makes people possible for our society to make societies happen to people in their societies , not only would be the lives of human beings , but it would be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to be worried that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big selection are <unk> us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , it &apos;s not possible in the <unk> . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish know something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break it down , it &apos;s so that everything is possible down , drop them happiness .
they raise the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost limited with perfect security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by biology by creating new life and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand , and it &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to the minimum components .
we have digitized nearly 20 years , when we sequenced the <unk> of the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate lives , or are we able to create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , who can replicate the smallest genome in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred genes of the 500 genes from the 500 or something .
so what we decided to do is we decided that the only way in front is this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and make some of that fundamental questions .
and so we started to think about the question , we can synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that had never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps , our steps of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write about genetic code has evolved very slowly , and yet , increased , and our final point would sit on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it took actually a few years ago with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the more mistakes you make .
so , we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and the <unk> .
this was our first time , starting with digital information , the genome phi x <unk> .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a <unk> molecule , and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and <unk> bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released from the cells , and came back and killed e. <unk> .
i recently talked to the oil industry , and they said that it was this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think this is actually a situation where the hardware can actually build your own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to launch with digital information in the computer , this digital information is really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the <unk> was a mistake of 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 . if we used the original original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of the 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with other <unk> pieces of overlap with other <unk> , so that they fit together .
we have a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have installed <unk> .
think about that : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t and t .
now , <unk> of this letter -- these letters , in fact , are about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose of any of those amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences .
initially , we only signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
we &apos;ve created the pieces so we could just take them apart with enzymes . there are machines that repair these repair and bring them together again .
and we &apos;ve started making pieces , starting with some of the pieces , starting with the five to <unk> letters , would put in each other to <unk> these together up to <unk> .
in every step , we made these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with 100,000 tubes -- and then this isn &apos;t just going to grow in e. <unk> . it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of molecular biology . and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of <unk> <unk> that uses biology to repair dna that can put together these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million wheel radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
so , 12 to 24 hours later , everything has made together like this .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally <unk> , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space can exist in space and move to <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
this is a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by this processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve used to use these processes -- in fact , we &apos;re using it with the right design of the songs of the songs of the pieces that we have .
this is not a <unk> it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is footage about a long length of seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve been doing recently .
that &apos;s about <unk> letters in <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever been created by humans .
it &apos;s got a <unk> from over 300 million .
if we look at it with a <unk> of 10 and no traffic would plot it <unk> pages , only around this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how would we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complex with bacteria .
it &apos;s so much easier if you &apos;re in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out and you have another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about this cloning .
in <unk> , the chromosome is the cell in the cell , but we &apos;ve only recently shown that you can have a complete transplant of a cell to come to the other and could activate this .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get something further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species in here , or a third chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every time we had a second chromosome in one second of one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that has lost a lot of the biology in a time of biology .
there are enzymes called enzymes that are actually called dna <unk> .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no , the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added in .
it was <unk> in the cell phone and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and we had only one cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
so all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve gone through .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can change the <unk> , things pretty dramatically .
now , i argued that this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years ago .
and i argued that we might be a new form of the <unk> explosion in which massive , new <unk> based on that digital design could be .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re over to nine billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people today on this planet have existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh food and clean water , medicine , for <unk> billion people .
it becomes a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion barrels of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . this is a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that this is the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re <unk> in first line of the biological reality , and that &apos;s the point of our imagination .
we have today , because we have technologies to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the possibility of building a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you &apos;re able to make these 20 different different kinds of genes or create these processes to optimize or create drugs new vaccines , we can change with a only small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or so on .
this is a <unk> of actual <unk> that we &apos;re working with , which you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what they look like . we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have <unk> fuels in the <unk> and third generation that are relatively likely going to be a lot higher than <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that we think of biology is a large impact on the cost of the cost or the limitation of their availability , if we look at co2 as a material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to be that path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be thinking about the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 .
but in our finding the world , we have all sorts of different kinds of ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , with almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 from methane to methane as being hydrogen .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon dioxide that could just be brought to <unk> , <unk> carbon dioxide in the fuel to drive that process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , you could do that at ted .
but at the same time , we &apos;re working on the same way for the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;ve always seen a year in the back of it , and we have a dollar in the back of it .
i think that this can be changed by <unk> vaccines in <unk> vaccines .
this is what the future might look like with changes , it can accelerate now , and it &apos;s accelerating , and perhaps <unk> .
we are moving away from people to improve humans , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to you to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s all the time . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the lhc , the lhc has the greatest scientific experiment ever published -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a second of the universe -- and it &apos;s like 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine geneva from geneva .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these <unk> detectors in detectors .
that &apos;s what i work on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so that you see the scale .
september last year , the machine was going to go for the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
there &apos;s huge differences in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is the entire route to <unk> the lhc , then intentional with a part of the lhc , to make a particle of the lhc .
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest <unk> , or this , as someone went to the google side , and the front page was found .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the science .
now , about a week later , there was a problem with the machine later on .
these are wires <unk> <unk> when the machine runs down .
well , the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; no , no . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford it because if you &apos;re very far cool , you &apos;re going to be called <unk> .
with minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between stars , these wires can be that tension .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and so , the wires , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , met <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is <unk> , when you think that magnets weigh over 20 tons and a half tons .
so , we &apos;re about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to take away what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to turn it up and expect to collect the data in june or july , and sit down our journey , to try to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , a kind of spark of crashes again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject anything .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to reach out about our borders , make the value of things like the lhc .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect to change that .
however , recent recent is something interesting in my life and my career has happened that i have brought me to think completely .
the result is that i am , no matter where i &apos;m going to be treated like the doom of death .
seriously -- the doom of death !
for example , they &apos;re very concerned to me and say , &quot; well , don &apos;t you fear that success ?
have you not been afraid of your entire life , and you &apos;re never going to create a book that anyone in the world is interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really the power .
people said , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re not afraid to have success ?
do you have no fear that you kill you the humiliation of a <unk> ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to <unk> your life for your life , and you never come out and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? &quot;
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;m going to be afraid more things that nobody would do .
like algae -- and other things like algae .
but if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this recently , and i ask myself , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it obvious that by someone &apos;s supposed to be expected to do that , he &apos;s afraid to do it ?
and what about the creative enterprise , they &apos;re going to make us sure about the relationship of the state -- in a way that they don &apos;t do professions ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remind myself in his 40 years as a chemist to remember if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists are not given the call of <unk> people &apos;s reputation .
but we writers seem to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , they seem to be incredibly unstable .
all you have to do is to look at the bitter <unk> <unk> of really great minds alone , the young and a lot of hand died .
and even the ones that don &apos;t actually have <unk> of them , seemed to be very neglected to their real talent .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview
a extraordinary statement that they can do about their work .
the question i want to ask everyone here is : is this idea for them all right ?
you may feel that ? because only one centimeter , i feel like i feel , i don &apos;t feel comfortable with this notion .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch her in the next century .
i find it better if we encourage our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation -- very dangerous , very dangerous , to start with this dark path of thought -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now about the world &apos;s work as the work of the world &apos;s success of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of like friends -- it &apos;s very likely to get my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this is the kind of thought that you can get to get nine in the morning to start drink gin . and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of <unk> , i seems to write a way to write a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
so somehow , i have to find a way to find a way to write a safe distance from what i &apos;m going to do with my very natural distance about how the reaction is to write .
this quest to <unk> me into greece and the old rome .
please join me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the ancient greece and over rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of a <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source of man , which comes from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> <unk> demons .
from socrates , he was known that he would have believed that he would have a <unk> that <unk> him from further distance .
the romans had the same idea , called the <unk> creative spirit , a <unk> genius <unk> .
this is great . the roman thought was a really genius that was a particularly bright individual .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s a distance , that &apos;s the distance from the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of <unk> was certain things , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at you all look at you guys , everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational system , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual individual .
for the first time in history , you &apos;re listening to people or those who call a genius , rather than having a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that this is <unk> our artists over the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t really rational the <unk> of 500 years of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as everything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was that i &apos;ve heard the absolute <unk> of the creative process .
a process that has been -- like everybody knows that it has ever been trying to do something -- so in other words -- not always any common -- it &apos;s not always any common act .
in fact , in fact , he can feel <unk> .
she would say it was like a <unk> train .
it was going on to her country on her land .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that they could only do one thing , one , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part will never forget -- she said , there moments that there were moments in them .
she caught the poem on its tail and moved it back into her body and took it to the sheet of paper .
at this opportunity , the poem was <unk> and intact , intact , but backwards from the last word for the first word .
when i heard that , i thought that this is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i &apos;m going to have to get up to the same time every day and sweat , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable with <unk> and really uncomfortable .
but even i have this thing in my lab , sometimes this thing is <unk> .
and i appreciate that many of you have done that .
and even i had work or ideas that are from a source of me , that i can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing for ?
and how do we deal with that relationship without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example is the way you can do this for a musician , and i could interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom impulses , who was trying to master , these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him , and to fight them with them .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he was one day on a <unk> in los angeles , and then everything changed .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so , he starts to get this old <unk> in him , like <unk> , and i &apos;m going to be tracked by that song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just stopped .
and he finished all the <unk> and doing something completely new .
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you see that i &apos;m driving ? <unk> .
and i look at this kind of song out of the way i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> is somebody else .
walk and <unk> leonard cohen . <unk> cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed the whole .
it &apos;s not the work itself . it was often as dark as ever ever .
it could be a <unk> , wondrous , bizarre work , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing , which wasn &apos;t entirely tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of how i worked , and it &apos;s been saved me .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i was just supposed to <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was spoken to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i talked to my comment on an empty corner of the room .
i said , &quot; well , listen , you know , you know , and i both know if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely true , right ?
because you look at that , i &apos;ve got investing . i don &apos;t have investing more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and you have to show your percentage of money .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell you do .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you the record , give me that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following the following , centuries ago , in the deserts of deserts <unk> people with holy dances with holy dances , and the music gathered for hours .
these have been great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rare , something special happened , one of the performer was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen you have a performance like this .
it was as if it was time and the dancers of a kind of <unk> <unk> . he did nothing differently when he ever did it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything made up .
and all of a sudden he appeared no longer in human human being .
it was <unk> from the inside and down and down through a <unk> fire .
when something happened then , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
if you have a performer in spain , there &apos;s something magical done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancer wakes themselves up and shows 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday is -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go up to those heights .
and maybe someone will never name any of god &apos;s name if it turns out , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning of the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of her existence .
if you may only believe that you are down a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for an <unk> time of your life , somebody else &apos;s passed on somebody else if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , that &apos;s changing everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with safety of the past months , while i was working on the book that i was working soon when the dangerous , frightening , very expected <unk> of my <unk> success .
what i have to say constantly to say about it , if i &apos;m mad , is not afraid .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
however , for your contribution to your contribution , whatever you will be .
if your job dance is dance .
if the dumb divine genius that will give you to the side , you decide , for a brief moment , a kind of wonder of wonder by your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> <unk> ! <unk> .
and if not , yet , your dance yet .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you for yourself .
i believe that , i feel like we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you for granted , just that you have the mere human love and the <unk> <unk> for that .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed the two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> size , which was nearly three million years of the lower 48 states for nearly three million years .
but this doesn &apos;t press very enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick of ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> is the blind heart of our global heart attacks .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red marks .
as you can see , it grows to the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which out here .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming of frozen ground to the arctic ocean , where it &apos;s large numbers of <unk> carbon , which is where , if he <unk> , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere , it could double the amount of it if we cross that critical period .
already today <unk> <unk> in alaska of its own area in alaska methane from itself .
professor <unk> walter <unk> in alaska is to another group of other flat ocean in alaska .
wow !
it &apos;s fine . the question is , how will it be <unk> us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat spike drops greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are far bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea sea levels are , they &apos;re going into the ocean .
these rivers take place slowly .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month of researchers , the researchers signed up a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed up over a few <unk> is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up new lakes , which was glaciers in a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you <unk> , most of the water is <unk> .
in california , there &apos;s a 40 percent reduction in reducing the sierra leone .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and the predictions of how they read they &apos;re serious .
these <unk> in the world will lead to a dramatic increase in a dramatic increase .
and the disasters all around the world have been <unk> , and it &apos;s never going to be an isolated metric .
four times as many times in the last 30 years like the <unk> 75 .
this is an entirely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years we have 70 million tons of co2 emissions every 24 hours -- 25 million tons per day in the oceans .
look at the eastern pacific area right now , from the american continent western and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a radical decline in the sea .
the largest single factor for global warming , besides logging , which 20 percent is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the lowest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two major <unk> <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
these are the ones that were taken out over the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> last <unk> spent on promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me something .
for christmas , i went home to my home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened on christmas day .
one of the commercials of the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> of <unk> is a <unk> , happy guy .
it &apos;s in the skin and plenty of in america , and it &apos;s helping to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is <unk> every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain in wages and bread .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clearly . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has written in terms of the two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
we see climate change as a serious danger in our business .
and so we set ourselves up to the top of the <unk> , a significant significant <unk> spending to spend a <unk> on the path to the truth .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also a good smell .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave it to us .
<unk> charcoal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of one of the main reasons for the global warming is global warming , is the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , everything .
look at that , this is the place today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our challenge , and the challenge of the national security challenge .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that we &apos;re all connecting together is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free , to free ourselves from this <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to get back to work to make us safer , and help stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence upon the old , messy <unk> that are <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments for creating a good job .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , walk alone .
if you want to go far , walk together . &quot;
we need to go far , and it quickly .
thank you .
so i &apos;d like to start asking you to ask your childhood <unk> when you were playing with <unk> .
as they realized , how do you get out of the hands and <unk> that <unk> <unk> and moves , you actually learned to think about solving and changing problems and changing things .
the spatial thing is closely associated with it , how much we understand a lot of our environment .
this question was so emotional that we decided to explore and we developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be moving with your hand , you can detect each other , you can figure out your motions , and you have a screen and a stick .
much more important , physically , are so physically , why you can get them just like <unk> and access to your hands .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation digital data .
and when these resources are being physical and a conscious mind for their movements , to see each other and the subtleties of our <unk> with them , then we can study new and entertaining <unk> .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , and if i <unk> it into a direction , the video will play forward ; if i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are take each other .
so if i put them side with each other , that &apos;s their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and down .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like color like that with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;ll mix .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as well as languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we can give people the possibility of the rapid trial and the results immediately .
this is me -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m modeling <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you &apos;re going to end up with a <unk> , and you &apos;re trying to make words , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you will send those over a dictionary .
then , about 30 seconds , again , <unk> , and you have a new <unk> , and you try new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and get a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
there are some people who are testing it .
this is our youngest <unk> at the bottom right there .
it turns out he was just a pile of <unk> .
so they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters in the scene by the way he <unk> the <unk> from the table .
this is a <unk> the sun .
the sun goes up on the sun .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> , and he can actually put the characters together ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
so the last example i have time to show it is to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve developed recently and <unk> as sound and <unk> .
each has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can see these sounds in the sequence of the sequence that can be <unk> in any sequence .
and you put it in just by a way to put a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that they can change live , like hall and filter .
you put it together with a particular tone , and it tends to be for the hire .
and then <unk> effects like pace and volume , which you apply to the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to add the <unk> into two <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that in a row , you expand and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do a little drums on this .
and i just hook the drums up with the drums that i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by the pace of the speed .
and i &apos;ll just hook up the filters again for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as you change .
so i don &apos;t have to plan for them at the end of it , but can make you improvise .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence of the sequence by the <unk> to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new desire to develop new <unk> , like our brains and work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re doing in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you is that we &apos;re on the verge of <unk> to the interaction with digital media interacting with digital media that will bring information into our world , the demands of our demands .
thank you .
and i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m delighted that i am there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i &apos;ve got to step back a little step , and it &apos;s busy <unk> with modern molecular molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started from , because i just wanted to know , and everything even wanted to do what i learned in the study of today .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i kind of wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think the molecular biology in general now , generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and more importantly , will be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like these entire genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s now craig venter in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make <unk> , which is , gasoline from algae .
there &apos;s also things that are going to come up with all the rest of the day , which is most people not yet , for example , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are genetically <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue on endlessly .
and so from interested in this technology , i &apos;m going to move on to this technology .
so now why are now hacking ?
most people know most of the people know this from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and then it becomes the media , yes , the hacker breaks somewhere somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad to <unk> , because that &apos;s not what it is like that , which is what it really started to do , which is what it &apos;s really like .
and in fact , the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , started <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and it &apos;s got it up to software , but there &apos;s also it in the <unk> , but there &apos;s also a whole <unk> , there &apos;s all sorts of <unk> that are doing all kinds of <unk> things .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also program , and you can also program it to be <unk> , and that &apos;s what i find is incredibly fascinating , and that &apos;s what i find is incredibly fascinating .
it really has only taken the form of eight music to these kinds of networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , that &apos;s originally from switzerland , that is originally from switzerland and with a cooperation in india , but now there &apos;s members or active people everywhere in the world .
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find this way that you can get access to this kind of playful application , which is such a cruel deal of dealing with that .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more kind of kind of a forum , where you &apos;re looking at it and online .
they &apos;re a bit of an engineering approach , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to be wondering , <unk> questions .
and based on that networks that the whole popular thing has done , has evolved a scene that has a little bit of a <unk> that i &apos;d like to do .
here in the upper left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a school kind of school , a private school , non-profit association , where everyone can .
so , kids , old , all kinds of people go around with it , just a lab , and look at what can you do when these <unk> go .
down here on the left is a group in indonesia called the <unk> , which is a very long time .
more than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also engaging in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and yes , also , <unk> , and combine it in quite a kind of artistic way .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in the <unk> museum with an exhibition on the subject .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s most pretty young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really what everybody &apos;s united up is this fascination with is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and it turns on to society at the order of a society and ask questions , ok , what do you know what you &apos;re going to do , you have to engage with this ?
so , okay , to <unk> biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you &apos;re looking at in a lab , which is sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , very <unk> , highly <unk> , educated academics , and so on .
and our approach was to say , well , okay , so you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because each every every one of each <unk> has actually increased technology than most of the <unk> , which is really that .
and the premise of that premise , with that premise , has been trying to have brian <unk> in england , an <unk> <unk> , then has been a <unk> , and then has taken a <unk> , and then it has begun to be bacteria .
so everybody , once again , a soup of soup , which he has dropped out of time .
i was trying to do this in my lab , trying to scale a little bit , and then take a look at ebay onto ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so that &apos;s the way to do it at home , to try and do it at home .
and this is <unk> , which is just mentioned <unk> , that yeah , kind of , kind of a <unk> of molecular biology .
and yeah , so you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing home alone to go up to the big ones , and so much larger organizations , which are even more likely to do in <unk> form .
and then , it &apos;s also about , okay , who are we , okay , what we want to do ?
and what are our values and what are our goals , what are our goals ?
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> out of that .
so this was kind of intuitive , so everyone just got this way , and what it &apos;s going to do is put it in .
it came , i think , a very good code .
and then we &apos;re not engaged in this , but it &apos;s really , i think , has been quite good at it , people are quite convinced , so people are quite convinced .
and we actually tried to get it back to the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re out of the <unk> , in terms of the <unk> , in terms of the academic world .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
a project that i &apos;ve done with the <unk> in switzerland even was a so-called optical trap or optical <unk> .
this is down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then the laser <unk> the laser <unk> and then tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of things .
this is another project from the french group , from paris , which has worked , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like to do , so it &apos;s such a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so he has been dealing with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
and he then built this helmet , and in the cooperation building this helmet , that &apos;s the ran .
and then there was the visitors going in the room in the room to sit down on this helmet .
and then they were measured , and depending on what they thought they were , or as they &apos;ve thought , they were different lights on space .
quite a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which has been to do with this <unk> , is that the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to replicate gene , to reproduce , <unk> , fragments of fragments that can make you visible .
and the machines that make such a difference , they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy the least expensive that you buy .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can too do much .
so this is just an application of a lot that you can do with it .
i think , somehow six hundred dollars , or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s <unk> .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
one project i had started to do was build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yeah , like such a kind of <unk> , which shoots one kind of <unk> , two centimeters or something .
you <unk> <unk> on <unk> and then the <unk> <unk> into these <unk> , and then i ran up to <unk> and then made it <unk> .
so the device that you see is that it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype , which has been pretty wild , but it has looked at so on a branch , and it &apos;s got pressure , and that was the pressure that was broken up .
and then i took a <unk> and it &apos;s connected .
a <unk> , if you do full of water , have the enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s so 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and then you can get the particles strong enough faster , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euro or something , <unk> <unk> around the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , right now , this is the <unk> of the scene at the moment that the availability of technology to increase , and also the information and the <unk> , that more people can get engaged in it .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a very little clue of this , and also there &apos;s no chance to make it really good .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same as if you did it or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make useful decisions in society , and if you want to make good decisions in society and the conversation , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you can understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> open source of <unk> and citizen science .
so , you know , as a citizen , you &apos;re going to be able to spread through these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of <unk> .
these are the people who have <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
this is quite a remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
that is , i think , there are fewer people on the ground than actually exist .
so i know from some people who don &apos;t put it .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and partly , with these <unk> , they put in the places there .
and that &apos;s very , very beginning .
as i said , it was just beginning to have .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and that &apos;s now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> who are represented throughout the world .
and of course , we &apos;re hoping that we tend to expand and expand so much , and then they &apos;re very much similar to it , so that we can take people involved .
and i invite you to be watching , and even once myself , what do you try .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and then you get enough energy , you go too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moved to me as a designer , but also in the realm of <unk> <unk> and all of the things in the field of user experience .
so it &apos;s about how you can see people in interactive media so that they can use interactive media , and so they can create an early experience .
and i believe that the interactive media is within us <unk> , cognitive models , which means that in our biological memory , a very long time ago , and that we can just be <unk> by interactive media .
and this is quite amazing , because in fact you think that these <unk> things that are actually going to happen in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future that the future is right in our future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future of the future .
so what are these <unk> models now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to you briefly .
to <unk> cognitive models , these are the models that we &apos;ve pointed in the same time .
so to this <unk> models , we &apos;ve heard a basically natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds very unusual .
now , i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;ll show you by trying to prove you &apos;re a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since of these <unk> models , that &apos;s very , very simple to speak , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains , actually , is itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , and what of course tells us is that the linearity is normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
what is this with virtuality now that is the most fundamental thing about the world .
i want to prove that to you .
how many doors have the house in which they live in ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that spontaneous , spontaneous , but it &apos;s going to happen here , right now .
they go through this house through this house , in <unk> them , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they <unk> reality , and they &apos;re very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so , there &apos;s really trouble giving us the virtual reality in the <unk> , for example , that we can actually do this all the time .
and that this wealth of reality is to <unk> the virtual reality of the <unk> , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in this head , the memory goes off .
in this head , knowledge <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination had been passed on knowledge .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality as well .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a small trip .
yeah .
the interesting thing is that at this time , the man at the same time was <unk> and media itself .
now , if you keep a piece of paint .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given change .
but i &apos;ll come back to that again .
it &apos;s been a <unk> tool since always <unk> .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , called <unk> , to protect knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still dependent on very , very strong .
the author of the book <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to the <unk> , we still <unk> hours a year on <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a kid that &apos;s going to be able to reach most of the time that the most <unk> of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love depends on stories that we were as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s a lot further back in cultures , in the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as a particularly impressive media , we have known that we have a se in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i &apos;ve brought one example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , from island to island to raise food .
and they did this with the so-called <unk> .
you know , maybe you &apos;re going to know a little bit about it , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in it .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they have used this as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is , is the navigation and the topography of regions of the regions of the <unk> .
where the language was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and the rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and , of course , has allowed them to be able to do these songs and go back to the left , to the right , to the right , to the right , to the right , too .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore , to get up from the top of a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happened to the <unk> age machine .
we &apos;ve been moving into what &apos;s called a <unk> .
what happened is the machine age and happening is the book , and it &apos;s happened to be the <unk> .
and that is that this is happening that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book , and on the image .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve got to <unk> of god &apos;s point of view .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
the <unk> for the age of age .
what caused our shock to our thinking and our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> forces the <unk> forces .
and they &apos;re in the course of centuries more and more <unk> had been through the shock of <unk> .
that means that instead of remembering we have standardized , very common , in mass common patterns of memories that we have limited memories of our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
we have an abstract <unk> language .
we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to do it anymore in pictures , but we don &apos;t put it in pictures of our language .
we &apos;ve got used to that thing linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the <unk> as the rule , and there are only exceptions , like , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re still getting arrested as a <unk> very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age of age and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called <unk> call .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very much like science fiction .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which allow us to get these things back to us again .
it &apos;s about virtuality ; it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to just explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts like , for example , the <unk> reality , that is called the extended reality .
and so , of course , <unk> of my talk , that may sound like we don &apos;t have in existing existing economies , virtual worlds , to the model of the <unk> .
and other examples are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all this ability to accept our ability to accept virtuality is a real habitat .
i &apos;m at degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you &apos;ll just get up for a long time , so you can get yourself in the pause for the project .
and this project , i &apos;ve brought along with the example of how again that <unk> , cognitive models will be addressed .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
and of course , what <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i &apos;m computer games , you probably have a very likely point in front of eyes that any people would get people in front of some kind of <unk> or that they &apos;re playing with some kind of <unk> .
anyway , you can do that in there .
this is a game for out .
and that &apos;s what i think that i find the outside world , so i find the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the virtual world is the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize to me , i apologize to it .
you can also explain that much better , there &apos;s still a lot more there .
and it &apos;s that i &apos;m looking at a city by looking at places in which places are positive or negative .
and so i get from the city of a whole different sight , which is a whole different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city and a way to get a whole different virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at now .
ah , what you can see here is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing in the same way .
of course , this virtual world walls in our urban walls is really clear .
and with some kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag had been asked to be a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about it instead .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate what &apos;s in there .
but i &apos;m just going to do a little bit more curious .
yes , children are from nature curious , or rather than being curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a <unk> of the house , so i &apos;m sure , of course , with the topic of curiosity , and how we &apos;re going to lose the curiosity , and why we might lose , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with in the actual existence of existence .
if professors are becoming curious , then they tend to <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a <unk> on the subject natural user interface interface with design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the sudden you &apos;re going to start with the natural world , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and there i &apos;m only one of these little devices , because things are always more intuitive , more and more intuitive , and you have to look at what &apos;s really important to us , which is actually to be , of course , for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
so , i &apos;ve got to deal with it , of course , and intuitively .
maybe even look at this .
why does that happen at all ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , this is what we &apos;re looking at now from the third to the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so the modern in the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through language .
that means you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you &apos;ve talked to each common language , you could communicate with each other &apos;s same cave , or in other areas , cities have created this way , or villages , has created a way of creating cities .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , a little bit of a living .
you also had to learn , you know , not a bullet can be talking about nature , but we learn it <unk> and private course .
that became the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
and that was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> <unk> in the form of writing , which is called <unk> and alive , i &apos;m going to start it , and i &apos;ll start it in stone and so i &apos;m doing it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s of course a different different coverage of that , as if there &apos;s a living .
but then <unk> was going to pull off the script as <unk> .
and then the next generation where we &apos;re actually mostly living .
this is just using pressure and <unk> <unk> script and others .
at the time , it &apos;s just a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , are you really insane when the people are starting to read , then the later , and this is , of course , <unk> .
and of course , that completely , of course , is completely because we see the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
and these two worlds are just pop , new and old .
and the exciting thing about this is when you look the guy , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> of the <unk> .
but now not at the local level , but it &apos;s a global level .
we understood the weather is global .
that is the global ecology of ecology .
not when i think local , and the neighbor is less green , then it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from the local village , actually become a global village with the same principles , as well , of course , but also the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village , who did what , and when you know , it &apos;s happening today about these <unk> of our self from a global level .
is it that we know global pioneers and faster and more and better .
as it used to be on the village .
now , in front of the background , i &apos;ve got to look at what &apos;s going on with it , which is , what does it mean for us , what does it mean for us , but what &apos;s the difference is , what do we do ?
because often , people can do it , they can &apos;t do it , because they can do it .
so , you have to deal with it , because it &apos;s not just that , and not just changing it , it &apos;s different , it &apos;s going to be better .
you know , you &apos;re busy , as well as the student , with the issue of perception and the <unk> .
and , of course , that &apos;s what you &apos;re starting to look and look at , and look , okay , now i just look at the inner self .
and what does it actually look like ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re <unk> ?
and what does it mean , obviously , , intuitively , and how do our channels work , and how does it work ?
because steve jobs has said to <unk> you , you know , <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at detail when i want to make some <unk> or intuitively <unk> , which is in the core .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information about ?
information is a difference that makes a difference .
now , many use of the word , but actually it &apos;s not what it means of detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding information is going to be information , when it comes from information , and from information , i know how to turn things out , and of course , i can do things as well , or of course .
and of course , how does design impact on perception .
so a lot of natural , in a vessel , but i look straight , where is salt and pepper in there .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , and then it will end up thinking where there is something in it .
and the left just intuitively , and i hope , and i hope that no sugar is there , the salt .
but also , our perceptions themselves , how makes you mind it .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle of circle looks larger than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re very much <unk> , and yet our perceptions change , depending on what context is .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on it .
<unk> <unk> should be working .
there &apos;s going to be some of my glasses .
so , it &apos;s &apos; n .
a second circle starts to touch certain resemblance or associate .
it &apos;s called <unk> or a <unk> that affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the designers , they usually have the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> nearby , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
in third , they &apos;ve forgotten .
but this is an essential component of what if you want to make things as well as possible .
the next phenomenon , which is also interesting is looking at this .
it sounds very trivial , but very exciting about how exciting happens when you &apos;re closer .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;ll see back in front of you .
because they <unk> an assumption that they see something that you see , <unk> circle .
so , that means we &apos;re <unk> our vision before we see it again in the back of our <unk> back to the back of our <unk> to say , okay .
i have <unk> cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see , what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , again , that comes back .
and then you go back to the front , because that &apos;s not what you &apos;re looking at in the back and don &apos;t say , look at what you &apos;re looking at .
and then it &apos;s going back to the back , and then it &apos;s really first seen .
so , a very , very <unk> process , how things are happening , and what do they do for <unk> things .
i don &apos;t know who you know this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
it &apos;s now trying everybody to recognize from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what &apos;s recognized .
does anyone see something ?
a <unk> , exactly .
if i saw that that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , then you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now look at the <unk> .
and now , look at it .
this is , i &apos;ve actually <unk> them now , that they don &apos;t realize no more pattern , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short period of time in a very short period of time .
and that &apos;s the projection of seeing this projection , <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to know , and now i &apos;m going to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
all right , very exciting processes that then , you know , gray process is actually not , but here in this <unk> mass in this <unk> mass .
does anybody know what three seconds is ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present in the <unk> , then i can also get very well <unk> , where i &apos;m going to do it by three seconds .
that &apos;s what it has to do as a present .
and then it moves into the past and so i can get very elegant <unk> , for example , on the computer , if i know that phenomenon .
what does <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
this means even if you know this , you &apos;re looking at what you &apos;re looking for as long , because i don &apos;t get <unk> , you know , because i don &apos;t get <unk> .
and <unk> milliseconds , also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the point of most perceptions that we have .
that means that this first thing is happening in a very rapidly fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re going to protect ourselves from our environment , so we can turn that forward .
of course , the designers don &apos;t deal with the issue of perceptions and neural <unk> or neural <unk> , but of course , primarily with the topic of <unk> .
so , like a human being , with certain things .
so , there &apos;s a lot of things that are practical , so <unk> aspects , or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where to reach .
now , there are also symbolic features , why is there somebody for such a little bit of a <unk> , where does hardly matter , so <unk> <unk> <unk> money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more than the <unk> , on the <unk> that we are as a <unk> of course .
back to my actual subject natural user interface interface and the topic , of course , which , of course , <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> means , how can i get a certain goal at a certain goal , or how can a users be able to do a certain goal in a certain sense , efficiently and <unk> a goal .
it &apos;s like the norm in that way .
how can i make a difference ?
can i do that directly or need i need &apos; n , or i need , i need , i know .
and fewer <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s .
that i &apos;m doing it just differently and fun , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and this is an intuitive <unk> , not first of the apple <unk> , <unk> elementary school , when i just want to make technological devices .
why ?
because in the general we &apos;re using this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user interface , for example , is five times faster on our goal .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something about classical music , you need to need five hours of software , and with this new type of natural software , it only has one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours , but you want to go home , you know , it &apos;s going to take you to the four hours of <unk> .
but i want to say that , of course , that it &apos;s a major event for us to make certain things .
if we &apos;re going to go back to the piece of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where we took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that we &apos;ve got to do with this is the next brain neural model or the mental model of the software model to have worked , which is the metaphor of a desktop , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so no longer , they &apos;re not a metaphor or ones , and they &apos;re a metaphor .
so , this whole thing made a <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot better , of course .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is working a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m making a lot more of the behavior as a change that looks like this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
in fact , i think that this is always a <unk> for success , which is an app that is going to be an app .
and then if i take a step back to these natural user interfaces , where i &apos;m by voice , by speech , by speech , by speech , by gesture , by definition , by gesture , is not by mouse and mouse and <unk> .
but that leads me to the point again , when are the things going to be more intuitive to be more intuitive ?
now , if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to put my little friend out here and see , what does that mean , from the point of view of <unk> , when now is really intuitive ?
and that is , for us people &apos;s always intuitive , if i have to think about it as well .
so apparently , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but they &apos;re just going to make their financial .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so , if we look at that , we can put existing output from one another to something else , for example , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as <unk> .
that means i can just have an intuitive , human <unk> on a software program , and the software is doing a lot more <unk> .
now , of course , the question , of course , is the question of human beings , and now i have to tell you .
this is what we call <unk> .
this is using each of us , and <unk> is an acronym and stands for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s all the power of you all the time , but it does unconsciously , and you kind of intuitive , or you could also be instinctively .
the model is already going to be in the womb , and is <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by us all the time , without knowing that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times of the activity of the <unk> , so in the sleep , you realized that there &apos;s less often a lot of <unk> than the day .
i can now be able to <unk> this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> in a <unk> .
and by the way , through this kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a metaphor of a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the <unk> metaphor .
and then i can transfer that whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
now , you &apos;ve got pies .
<unk> : now i &apos;m sort of <unk> with the object , can <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole whole aspect , can now filter this together and say , just show me all of the stuff with chocolate .
and have a interface like that , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and the curiosity does not make you learn .
that &apos;s why everybody who &apos;s here are and curious is , in fact , people who have a property that you cannot learn from .
i &apos;m going to take it around , basically , all this <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central part of this .
and it &apos;s based on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they add + spending about two grams phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
we could just glide as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we did no phosphorus and make it phosphorus .
it &apos;s so amazing that we &apos;re doing something about this , which is actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but no one talks about energy .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been <unk> for two years , and now we &apos;re going to have a lot more uranium in the world than in all of the <unk> .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> tons of uranium on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
it &apos;s making leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , driving less car .
the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
that &apos;s not protection .
this is how if i would say , <unk> your child , shut it three times three times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , then our entire earth sooner or later a <unk> .
that &apos;s why we have the <unk> to think about <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the <unk> are stored .
in the moment we &apos;re building maize and 30 pounds between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
that means we &apos;re going to lose more five times more than a new way .
we can , of course , first of all , to look at the <unk> .
and it &apos;s fine , packaging content .
for example , in <unk> , twenty percent of the world &apos;s <unk> are <unk> .
and because we get older , they will be larger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand <unk> .
we could reduce this of of course 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is in china in a second balanced .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s the proof that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus of the piano is going to be emitted across the <unk> constituents .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s the <unk> , right ?
traditionally we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you get people to do it , when you say that people are better if you &apos;re saying that , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> to stabilize than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a human being <unk> , you &apos;ll see the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is we really are too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then they weigh the ants about four times more than us .
i could use termites , but in the united states , nobody might take termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they physically work much harder than we , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re equivalent to their weight , 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we are too stupid , yes ?
you can be only <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ? one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that <unk> is going to be like a trees , right ?
yes ?
a tree is not a tree .
happiness not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> on trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees alone .
have you heard some of the <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence is going to be <unk> as a trees .
and where you see , even in a little bit of a little bit like lagos , the <unk> <unk> in agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> .
every year we lose three million tons that are really going to go back into these cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about this .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re guilty of as guilty of the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you &apos;re all saying that our own <unk> are going to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s good to be less harmful , less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to be a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest , not being there , yes ?
<unk> , yeah ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shot off , you would have taken emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in the brazil of where we take the nutrients away .
in fact , we can put nutrients in agriculture , in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re directly taking the waste of it .
in china , in china , is a <unk> , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that all of the western <unk> draws out that the city always has only taken off , but the farmers never got back .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers were going to go to cities and cities had to keep their resources away .
and so all of the western empires are always expanding , until they get the infrastructure more infrastructure and they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization over five years , because you always have been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat the food , you would expect food to be , until you look at the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to go and ride to nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat her for dinner , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the web , how you can take the nutrients back .
and the great thing about it is that the <unk> in the favelas around ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , so we don &apos;t have to be bad at all .
we can support them good .
so , of course , that &apos;s <unk> , but the plants themselves are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design , which is a farmer you can easily manage .
that means that the <unk> go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been <unk> .
you could just be able to <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then it would be ruins over years .
doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , as much bad .
we can support them good .
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to be in germany , in germany , in germany , in germany .
but unfortunately not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> in a little bit .
because the <unk> block could be the best back .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we &apos;re seeing it absolutely works .
we &apos;ve been deployed for three years now .
the dutch government explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need it overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a pile of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of <unk> control .
and the oil is going to replace us by others .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
it &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad sad , if you &apos;ve got it , if you have them <unk> , and they come with <unk> .
very inefficient .
but very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six <unk> of three kilograms of their lives .
here .
this is not scientifically correct because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> it is .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
a lot of what is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not a resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
asking questions , what is the right ?
not to burn a little bit better , and not to burn it and <unk> the whole materials to lose all the materials for the boat , but first of all , how do you make the cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving , to avoid reducing .
all the <unk> .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a green in the south .
no , that &apos;s just the right , yes ?
in every place where you &apos;re <unk> , from , you can do it again .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
as we think of north .
there &apos;s every footprint that &apos;s footprint .
if you walk , yes , almost every footprint the soil is .
because the soil is going to die apart , and the wind and the water is washing away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everybody means that the water footprint in the meadow is staying in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re talking in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , what about your wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , stop .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow <unk> of the car .
because , you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a picture of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , there we go .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> process , which is in room .
they can go and stand up where they are .
in two hours , they &apos;re building themselves .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they allow them to contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all of it should be <unk> .
a <unk> or a washing machine , you just don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that they have to go to biological systems .
the things that are only used to be used in technical systems .
but we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all direct ads , and that &apos;s not for the company <unk> per se , but they &apos;re now helping to make these products these products .
because we don &apos;t do things we don &apos;t do .
yes ?
so , when i go to dinner and say , it &apos;s free from <unk> , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck in there .
positive .
so it &apos;s not like <unk> .
not toxic up inside .
it &apos;s everything that is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can <unk> with the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> and the rubber in biological cycles , right ?
all of it is <unk> of it .
and if we succeed , of course , it &apos;s of course for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> worldwide that will be caused by the textile industry .
so , you &apos;re helping them with , ask for the people .
hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
because now they &apos;ve got the <unk> changed now .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really <unk> .
so let me help you a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s been represented in just one thing .
that &apos;s .
we can now do things like this , when they do <unk> , if they can <unk> , they can .
technical cycles are the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> on this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , who &apos;s going to go back to the circulation .
and so , in any store , you can do things like this .
if you come on that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if the moment is the waste .
all over the <unk> , it &apos;s almost almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
yes ?
by itself , if you take these <unk> , they <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , to plant trees .
it &apos;s the baby <unk> for all of the life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started an institute .
now there are a lot of people working with them , and they can all work .
there &apos;s extra chips in that club where everybody can participate .
so no longer saving , not eliminating , avoid reducing , no <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it matter ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of the description , i wrote that i &apos;m writing as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so in the english community .
<unk> are english of the written notes in <unk> music .
already , from the german to translating english into english , it can require more knowledge , and when it comes to poetry , it &apos;s about poetry .
it &apos;s really alien to what we musicians to do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just launched the written notes .
they think of the composer that the composer has seen everything that he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same or <unk> , like a verbal , when very seemingly <unk> <unk> , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not able to smell the flowers , not to see the level of the <unk> , not to feel .
that means that the nation-state needs to put this <unk> data on a different , namely , <unk> , systematic , non-verbal translation .
today i want to share with you what else i say , so <unk> , <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so , basically an translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do it in the german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be like translation for me to translate the translation for translation in translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> grades , the function of the letters .
so it &apos;s not going to take just reading grades , and do the keys on the piano or the right place to push on the piano or the right place to stick .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the letters in the title of the letters is only when you can see the language .
so for least , you need to use music for at least as well as the spoken language .
then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passive , or you can start to speak to the musical spring .
the work of the <unk> starts as much as the <unk> .
when you first chose a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you know , you &apos;re starting to <unk> about the emergence of composition .
you collect information from the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thoughts from composers himself .
you study the works that he has composed before and after .
you put it on .
the <unk> , writing .
what did he feel like ?
how were the circumstances and the politics ?
all i &apos;m interested in .
you &apos;re sitting in those days by looking at contemporary paintings or reading literature .
but in the world , however , you &apos;ve been able to know , as an interpreter , a poor knowledge of the composers that you play more often than , and it &apos;s going to be easier to feel <unk> and feel .
the composer is increasingly becoming a friend that &apos;s alive with them .
his concern is to write the piece of play , more and more and more to my personal cause , playing it .
now , the grades , everything else , as well as a record of the credit of composers , is just a scaffold , i turn that framework for , so i &apos;m now turning this framework to make sense of it again .
and i say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> what these sounds might have .
now for me , and for the composer , what you might mean for him today .
every note , every phrase takes a sense of meaning , because i feel it itself , because it &apos;s personal from my now personal <unk> .
it has to be in this room for me now , and now i can &apos;t be able to convince my audience here , that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience that i &apos;ve been doing so long , and i &apos;ve worked in advance how to experience a new way of doing that .
as you meet a happy new day , again , in the same rituals of life , you &apos;re getting up with the same rituals of life , you get breakfast , and i &apos;ll do the same piece over the course of the new .
i have become more than a day , the seasons switch , my pulse is going to slow down at night , when the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer the sound that the sound goes back than home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience , consciously , unconscious .
and all that influenced me , and all of this affects my experience with the composition .
so , quite wonderful , if i &apos;m standing on a stage with a <unk> onstage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea inside , and again , that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make this wise music , and then they have experienced the audience , as the music communicates .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play that today like 20 years .
so i &apos;m going to know more life than today , and therefore , i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> on my palette to the emotions and emotions and emotions as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have new <unk> .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> with my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and a famous professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great luck , very early on , with 13 years old , and so i &apos;ve been to meet in my classes .
i was 17 at the time when i was in his class , once again , the last four tales of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
that &apos;s an <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
he <unk> and he said , &quot; so ?
it has to be the <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was about 60 .
well , with 17 , you &apos;ve got dreams , but you don &apos;t have a major memories .
i play today the piece every few years , and i &apos;ve always changed it for me , although not a single note changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of that in a completely different way . the monet has painted <unk> painted .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as you look at this moment in this moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
i &apos;ve also been older at the time when the predator wrote about <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived in only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to look back to the notes , even though i &apos;m talking to them .
to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connections to him .
most of all , if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to have something like spoken for spoken word for spoken language .
often the <unk> is so much that you learn the notes .
you learn to learn how to read just a word .
you learn to find sound to the notes on the instrument .
and then when all the finger and the right thing like how it &apos;s in the notes , they come out of sounds like music .
when it comes down , the students get the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not going to be talked about the interpretation in the <unk> .
all right , there &apos;s a <unk> on the front , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
<unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s all here .
but even if you translate these samples , it still remains some technical technical .
and it &apos;s not always interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget about a little <unk> .
namely , to make music on the instrument that are going to do their musical and feel before present .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn to sing , because the parents don &apos;t have <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it .
it &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and idea of the music to have it , then about another possibility , so about an instrument , to make sound .
people who never sing , have never been singing with my own body , as well as it is to make a sound .
he &apos;s a phrase from his own breath .
and the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to the sing , our hands and feet .
so the <unk> is the sequel to the sequel of my finger .
the tune from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to have more or more of music when it gets bored .
no more necessary to whistling a <unk> or sing .
each of their music is going to be <unk> by the outside with music with music .
surely , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i do , can you &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they &apos;re not able to learn , or learn how to train these little muscles , which are the vocal chords , the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re training .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
so , i wonder how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or a <unk> , as you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you may have no music , and you want no to do anything about it .
but what i &apos;d regret is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you know , there &apos;s no need to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and there i am saying , but sure enough , you can say whether they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it tells you , i don &apos;t know if i tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to stop classical music , because they don &apos;t have an instrument .
hear you consciously and say whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is to you or sweet .
say what you feel .
over time , they also get to <unk> , and they want to make more relaxed differences there , or <unk> even , even sir .
why am i asking now from my audience , that it may also sound active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to be there .
a piece that you never look at has no force whatsoever .
the food that was eaten by a cook or a chef <unk> cook , has got to be eaten , not only looking or looking at recipes or <unk> of the exchange .
so please listen to if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where the adults are actively doing , or at least active music is a kid who &apos;s up to a kid , a kid , and then it &apos;s easy to do it ?
can you also play me in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of having a blue flower now , a blue flower now .
and this sounds quite different than before .
that was the very first start of a very very very very very <unk> expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that is originally written in a hundred , a hundred years ago , or is it written at all about three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments of instruments .
there was no piano in the middle of the day as an instrument .
it was not invented yet .
i think that bach would have been enthusiastic , if he had the <unk> opportunities of today today .
i can see the <unk> <unk> that bach had had , on the stream of modern wing , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s also from beethoven knows that he heard more than beethoven &apos;s deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is capable of playing everything that is an orchestra that has rejected in the back of the time .
that &apos;s why the composers depend on us to <unk> the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> , which is just in the mind .
and also what they would think of in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m doing today , because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were you <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives the drive .
when i come to my little v the w , and next to me , this feeling is coming in .
i &apos;ll shoot something through my head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need , &apos; n great ?
that &apos;s what she loses for the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to do that , i have to do a little car ?
and then immediately , i think it &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward feeling .
so our organism has invented a great way to make such uncomfortable feelings as envy enough to disappear .
they can try and try and do things like revenge or things or things like <unk> .
i want to talk to you today something or something about this mechanism , or what you &apos;re doing with this mechanism .
the mechanism is from lying .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say no one on the purpose of a wall .
and then <unk> stones so that he &apos;s <unk> them .
in such a lie , you see the liars themselves not believe what he says .
it &apos;s very easy to check out the way that he &apos;s in mind .
he doesn &apos;t just fake them and themselves .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is that they don &apos;t deceive themselves .
they need these lie to get a <unk> to <unk> a <unk> .
they can make them less easy , yes , or even to collapse .
they need time .
that time is an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once has a woman <unk> .
this woman has complained afterwards , the portrait would not be seen .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be more similar .
in this place , and if you laugh , you know how important this lie is , and how much time you need to know something , what artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to the lie .
the artist shares something with them , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when they just look into the mirror .
the artist divides them in a portrait of something that they &apos;re only familiar with when they &apos;re going to look at this piece of art and again .
then this awkward sensation , it could not look like you can &apos;t see it , and it will always be more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in the art , in the <unk> , in the mythology of stories , in stories , it appeared .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked into the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful in all of the land ?
one day this mirrors , yes , there is a <unk> .
and behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true inform , also the mirror cannot lie , from that true climate .
but we should just be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell a woman to say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here it is necessary to understand what we can understand , and again , it &apos;s going to place again .
what we need to do is we need these lie , which is the deception we can &apos;t live in .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the <unk> , but also in the science of science that &apos;s great .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s story of <unk> .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of people .
that the human ancestor should and , yes , there was at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles wrote .
the human condition is supposed to be by the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people all <unk> .
why are we going to prevent people from something that is true , if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without those <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t <unk> these things .
we &apos;ve got to prevent people from things , and we have to get true of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly that mechanism comes out of this mechanism , and like the traces of the tracks that he leaves that point to something different than this great image of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife &apos;s told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
a <unk> student .
and she likes to do it especially because it has a propensity to <unk> .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> in that place , you &apos;re not true . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , always , if a human in a moral approach , is because of the <unk> , we should be trying to replace it with the <unk> while we &apos;re going to replace it as well .
you can do that once , and then you get the sentence .
even though i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they feel that the real truth of the truth .
this is a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there are no clubs where we can look at where we learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second time , the fire department .
he signed up .
and <unk> , you also say , you don &apos;t want to put the teacher out somewhere and you &apos;re excited when the fire goes off afterwards .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we are in charge of putting the dangers that others can do when they just get fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this is the one that <unk> on the heart of <unk> , that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
this is then just the words that we are in the language of the politically correct word <unk> .
in fact , we know something else about the case .
but we know when we &apos;re saying that , social relationships are very delicate .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , things like to be in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to give you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
according to logic , these <unk> , the willingness to , one other reality , than the ones that we know in the unconscious know that she &apos;s valid to spread out .
so , here i want to give you two , maybe three .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of them appreciate , very few of them don &apos;t need very few .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something of intellectual , telling about leibniz .
and you think of the soul , you know , somehow in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , it &apos;s called the <unk> , the <unk> , your mind .
and then if that <unk> <unk> over the people , then it &apos;s filled with the dignity , with nature that can only live , yes , with nature .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s to get from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that should be present for our lives .
and if you have these premise in front of eyes , you understand the logic that we have to experience with a lie through a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> process .
you know , you &apos;re familiar with the school .
this is now a <unk> that describes the logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you have logic , but also the willingness to lie .
which is to lie that you can just be wrong this logic .
in this room , three sentences come before .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly highlighted him .
so , a third sentence , which is immediately in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the saying , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who is dead , and can &apos;t be a <unk> .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech , the expression .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re correct .
and i can tell you everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make statements about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell testimony what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key is when i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul .
these things are correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness is immediately , you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence to do nothing with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and <unk> .
because in fact , we have to prove it , whether it &apos;s the soul or there .
but with this logic , it &apos;s just that two sentences are correct that two sentences are correct , and a third of the <unk> that looks like this , and we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it was impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue to continue doing these different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example , which is constantly filling up the <unk> .
and for this , they have to take another <unk> topic , a <unk> of philosophy .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do in the <unk> century .
there was an scholars that named johannes <unk> and after that is named johannes <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> natural nature .
this is not the soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you put the exact same in the middle between two <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know where a guy &apos;s supposed to first go .
so he &apos;s standing right in the middle .
so the <unk> is introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> forces solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
it &apos;s just when you bring another example , so if you &apos;re going to make a <unk> a haystack larger , it doesn &apos;t need reason for it .
it &apos;s automatically the right thing to do .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of pushed up in nature , it &apos;s going to be driven by the larger range that you have to put in your mind immediately , and then you have the feeling that you have to do a free will .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> here in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> of brain cancer .
there &apos;s a scholars that is called wolf <unk> , and he says , sometimes , the wolf <unk> <unk> says there is no <unk> .
now we can get back to the second sentence and say , if the wolf is <unk> <unk> right , then he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re going to read about every day in the daily newspaper , you can find that in this third sentence .
this looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , can &apos;t be made for their actions and claims for the responsibility , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s <unk> .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you have to prove it to happen , whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that , as if the first set of the first sentence in the world is not to take the opposite set of evidence .
and now you can just do anything like yourselves , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , the courage to make a lie .
practice this , for example , if you meet a human and then you can tell , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please , don &apos;t use german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call it a little bit more politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
you know , you &apos;re going to be able to find one that you have , for granted , that you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while it &apos;s busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there is no <unk> .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled .
because he has led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t touch themselves .
because in fact , this person isn &apos;t really interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in this to be <unk> in front of the need to prove to you that there are <unk> .
so , in the kind of history of <unk> , you see the brilliance of the lie .
and once again , if you have a chance to feel like this <unk> in other people , you &apos;re doing it because you &apos;re going to make other happy , if you don &apos;t remember that way in your <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to ask <unk> if i could mention it .
it &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and asked me whether i want to give a talk here and give me my idea .
i have to tell you , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it fell to me hard to talk about my idea .
and maybe i &apos;m going to show you my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum whole , very many of ideas .
and then i &apos;ve got it to berlin <unk> for berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> at the time that was called <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or <unk> .
but it &apos;s kind of <unk> like n <unk> , which kind of a hundred watts of blood square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was an crazy <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful to the <unk> that he has <unk> again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because all the left had been bad at all right .
it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
it was just that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> , where they were feeling evil <unk> .
the place of <unk> , but it was <unk> , and has wind and solar power , and i started in the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yeah , a lot of what i was told today , because many , many , many , many beautiful expressions were that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i &apos;ve been working for 11 years to collectively , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and i came up with <unk> <unk> , and then we have become <unk> <unk> , and then i became <unk> of the company <unk> of one of the world &apos;s greatest <unk> in the world .
and i brought a project i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
and the title of talk was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started talking with a relatively <unk> story , where you could just ask a memory of life today .
on this island , this is the island <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people .
they have an renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you &apos;re more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they &apos;re always saying why ?
we have 20 percent in germany already .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , <unk> , the first contacts with the island , just in terms of the <unk> .
as big as big as it has to be a battery , so you have an island of 20 , 30 , 40 , fifty , maybe even renewable percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system everywhere looks like this .
by the way , a year , by the way , a year will <unk> electric performance in the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to happen , is <unk> <unk> , because you don &apos;t need permission .
it &apos;s fast .
you put a box like this .
and then it looks like this .
in that run , there are always three of the <unk> , two will always waited .
yeah , this is the burden down there .
we &apos;ve got very accurate data .
and the <unk> or whatever it is , or whatever it is , is a <unk> system or a system , which is only in small quantities here .
our goal was to say it &apos;s okay .
the <unk> is <unk> and the wind , controlling the burden of the burden that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the <unk> .
that means , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can make the whole net over the whole net .
of course , they can only be managed by , of course , in some ways here .
no one has made in the world .
so that &apos;s a little bit style , so you can also serve in your car <unk> over a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do because in <unk> ?
it &apos;s already going .
but if you want to get several of these <unk> <unk> , and you want to build a web , it becomes extremely complicated .
it will be a power station , which is then hydrogen , hydrogen , methane , power to gas or <unk> , that will be .
they &apos;re going to have to go to a <unk> and not just <unk> and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then did a whole bunch of simulations .
these were the very first calculation , six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
so yes , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the <unk> , when the <unk> five percent is rising .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would all be done ?
negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only at five people to build a new society back then .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green system , is the green system .
that our system has a <unk> , and it &apos;s because we are still 20 percent of petrol , and also a <unk> on the other stuff .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island has done , which is , we &apos;re great .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall hall in berlin , where we can sort of build the electrical relationship of the island at the scale of the island .
that means we were looking for finding the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> , and then became the japanese one .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of performance , and it can bring six hours to do that , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
over here we can simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the wire , to sort of mapping the <unk> on the web .
and you can see this whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see this again , we &apos;ll see the <unk> , here again , the <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since then was , since <unk> , the hall was finished , until today , everything between the whole system of electronics was designed to develop software .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the theme and the web and everything .
you &apos;ve got to communicate to the battery , you &apos;ve got to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty of the topic that you &apos;re on in this island today is that it &apos;s all <unk> on problems that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase renewables .
so this whole discussion , what &apos;s going to be back and forth at the moment is going to go back to the island , like to go back to the island of <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
and then <unk> offers this .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start around on the island of integrating <unk> , <unk> , because we can load the burden .
that means that if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can do that by &apos; n , you can <unk> , you know , you can do that , you know , the proportion of <unk> , but you will never give in memory .
and that &apos;s the obvious n there .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what you &apos;re going to do .
if we shut down the <unk> , you just don &apos;t have these spinning mass that kind of <unk> on the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just a <unk> mass of great electricity , where always the wave all over the wave around europe is <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look inside this net , see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ll start a few <unk> <unk> , then again , a little bit of <unk> steam in , and then again , a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly <unk> .
if you <unk> that somewhere , it &apos;s a long time .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have it , these spinning mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> with this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you can see what enormous <unk> there is .
and the message is , well , we have to stop these rotating masses , if we &apos;re sort of giving our goals to 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we &apos;re going to do that at all .
then we have to <unk> our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simple , the power plant , to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a <unk> right now , right away from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not the point .
and we &apos;re just trying to figure out , you know , the capacity , the capacity , <unk> capacity , <unk> can be <unk> by the net .
and fortunately now , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and to that purpose , people are always going to go and look at our <unk> , like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get there a little bit more .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had been in the past 30 years .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never come out of it .
we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of it that we are in the next 30 years , the same capacity to store the same capacity for the world .
simple , so it will come .
there will be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years now that scientists are looking at my side .
now , we &apos;ve got to get over 10 million <unk> now , and also , for example , a <unk> web now to <unk> .
this is going to happen in april the next april .
so , because of that , you know , there &apos;s a change that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s only from this <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussions , there &apos;s always been trying to do this <unk> , which is <unk> , they have a own little net that has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil <unk> or <unk> <unk> that are going to be <unk> somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to become an island .
then they only use what &apos;s in the sun and there &apos;s wind there , where they live .
and this is a bit of our vision of a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said they &apos;ve said power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and this is what we &apos;re doing , and this is the talk of <unk> <unk> that you can get again a collective , and it &apos;s a little <unk> .
and all right , i &apos;m going to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be a bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay in it , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you .
now , as steve <unk> , <unk> of los angeles , one day of los angeles , he was walking across the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who had a violin , who had two strings on a violin .
nathaniel <unk> was juilliard , suffered a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row at the center of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , <unk> hall , <unk> hall .
he just had a demo of beethoven &apos;s <unk> and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking about a very <unk> and <unk> clay on yo-yo <unk> , hillary clinton and hillary clinton in the baseball world of <unk> , and that &apos;s how the dodgers would never make it in the baseball world of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel was interested in <unk> to me .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already stuck with electricity and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that had been treated his whole life .
and in fact , in the same way , nathaniel <unk> was on nathaniel , when we started with our first class in <unk> disney hall , and he had lost this <unk> <unk> in his eyes .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison him in the sleep .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , a complete change .
it was like , as if the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction that was catalyst in my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle , he took his violin , and he started hearing some clips of <unk> some clips of <unk> , and then asked me to play , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , starting about beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that it was not only an <unk> knowledge of music , but it was connected to her also personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d otherwise know from my colleagues in <unk> of los angeles .
by making music in and talking about music , it was made out of this <unk> , <unk> man , who was still through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing .
nathaniel means music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with its imagination , is in something real <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
so this is the reason we &apos;re doing music : so that we can do something that is deep in all of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality that speech makes us all , is inspired , and inspired us , inspired and united and <unk> us .
what nathaniel offers , so it brought back the music to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought back to a family of musicians who understood his mind and realized him .
and i &apos;m going to play with nathaniel , no matter whether it &apos;s <unk> hall or <unk> hall , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known in my life a lot of fish .
i only loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate kind of thing .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was getting in <unk> after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could feel it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
and one day , the head of the company called the company of the company , and i asked if i could <unk> at an event about sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to figure out what this unimaginable is about our cooks , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have <unk> the ocean as we run bare forests .
it &apos;s hard to make the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
it &apos;s against a lot of arguments . <unk> contaminated the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are required for a pound of a <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted them to be supported .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the public called the public .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , as far out in the ocean that you can &apos;t eat the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out of our fish that are distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a whole of your own world .
these <unk> from <unk> to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing , what &apos;s her feeding ? &quot;
sustainable proteins , he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ? &quot;
so i called the next day , just before the event , to don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , do you know what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to have an opinion .
well , i <unk> with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a <unk> answer . until finally , with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , don , &quot; i said , &quot; well , what are the sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , you , skin , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and eating . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your own <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
we might think of two percent .
&quot; well , this is about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , do what &apos;s sustainable , chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish fell after that conversation fell after that conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know , the better you know , the better you know your fish , you know more .
i got it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had spoken to this fish for a long time .
she &apos;s in a sense called <unk> .
he came up with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> him .
stop twice .
it was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can &apos;t .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> , which were basically the wetlands .
they did that by using the country .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they <unk> water from the land and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically , not economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what these are many birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water in reverse .
they have literally <unk> the lever .
instead of doing the water , they used the channels to use the water to <unk> water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a <unk> acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and <unk> , and his company the ecological destruction completely vice versa .
the farm farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and these density , lush , lush .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we struggled through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> <unk> to my knees .
this is a rare one , <unk> <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of <unk> that &apos;s reminiscent of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> <unk> has spent the greatest part of his career in the <unk> national park .
i asked him how he has become such a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then it goes and falls down into more <unk> from rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i cut it down . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it make your fish so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the algae , the relationships , that is incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that there &apos;s such a rich system that the fish you would eat in the wild .
the split biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm that is not feeding their animals ?
in the moment , it was like a director who would demand a film machine .
and we <unk> around the corner and we offered the most stunning sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , literally a separation in carpet &apos;s so far .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now last year , on the site of 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and the <unk> private <unk> in all europe .
and i said , &quot; well , is a good <unk> , isn &apos;t the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is an <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the <unk> .
so the <unk> the <unk> the system .
okay , let &apos;s rethink it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , that <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city for 400 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly up 240 to the farm .
and every night they go 240 kilometers .
they can do that because they &apos;re the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly 60 kilometers to the farm and then fly it 240 kilometers back to the farm ?
do you for the kids ? &quot;
he was quoted me , and he &apos;s quoted at <unk> houston .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m never cooking by cooking .
and yet , when i tried to stay in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t tasted <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure as if you took a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something to go into the body .
she &apos;s developed over the course of evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t supply their fish . a farm which measures their success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it <unk> huge , because the water that &apos;s flowing through that farm comes from the river in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things out of those rivers that are these days , and these are chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it has fought by the system , and that leaves the water , it &apos;s cleaner than it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it clean the water .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> it in the atlantic ocean .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this story , as romantic as romantic , is also telling .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
now what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food that food is actually good .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re a lover .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> , we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that the things that the future of good food is somebody on and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than to feed .
a billion people are going to live today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because it &apos;s the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
feed crop crops , <unk> <unk> , <unk> chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time that we have been able to be , &quot; if we feed more people , how terrible can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the gift . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , an industry in <unk> , an enterprise , the quickly <unk> capital that enables this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not due to <unk> <unk> , but based on <unk> resources .
not through <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through <unk> , but through fresh water , not through <unk> and nets , it &apos;s not through the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that create any community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never made a really good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in two billion years <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
and businesses who are not just <unk> , businesses , who are to restore business instead of <unk> , businesses , who are <unk> <unk> , but experts in relationships , not just a lot of relationships .
because they are the people who are also experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because when that &apos;s good , when it &apos;s good , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> event .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter away after a certain cause of cancer .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it come .
and it &apos;s because in the <unk> , people are most active and they &apos;re on the <unk> over here .
we can step out one step further and organize the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we went on and went to age , we say 40 years or younger years ago , we see accidents that should be concerned about people .
and who sees <unk> , that &apos;s true of men .
so you can see that the point of information and data in this way is very <unk> in a living way .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for the content themselves ?
now what we have here is the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my talk in your field .
with <unk> , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a single year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue , and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong fan , so i click this out where the <unk> armstrong will mention , and i &apos;m mentioned .
now , if i &apos;d like to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i &apos;m looking at the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and i &apos;m going to take a step back .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you search for this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to do or not just <unk> .
you do something that is a little different .
it &apos;s something between us , and we think it &apos;s changing the way that information can be used .
so i want to go a little bit further , which is a little bit nuts .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> , and we cut them on a little summary .
that &apos;s the summary of a short overall view of it , a symbol of the area .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the popular people .
but even in that <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the themes that are on the popular wikipedia .
so i &apos;m going to vote for the government .
well , after i voted the government , i know that the <unk> that <unk> that is most of the year they &apos;re making .
this is really important , because this is an insight that are not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s only to see if you take a step back and look at the whole .
i can look at some of this summaries in time , and then i can go into the issue of time <unk> people in the year , and see everybody together .
now , if i look at these individuals , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some of them come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , there &apos;s a <unk> prize for a ted prize .
so we can jump back and look at all the ted prize for all the ted prize .
you see , it &apos;s surfing on the web for first time as if it &apos;s a network , not just by side , but more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can look at websites with them every single website like this .
so i can go back a step back and get directly to some specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s why , because you just look at these types of websites in this way , you can look at the whole level of websites in that same way .
so i can zoom in in a very recent place in a row .
here &apos;s the only demonstration that i &apos;ve given up to here .
and i can kind of have everything i &apos;ve seen now , again , <unk> .
and , if i &apos;m going to take a step back and look at everything , i can reinvent my <unk> , and here , i &apos;m going to look for <unk> .
and from here , i can go inside the side and go to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that keeps used back , and every time it makes the box bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking from drowning in information .
if we can do this , it &apos;s going to be these past <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , rather than just moving in information , we can get out of it .
and if we know , we can even pull out of it .
that &apos;s what i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion science fiction .
in my high school i went to school with the bus , every day one hour .
and my nose would always put in a book , a book , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and in <unk> , my mind was <unk> in my own worlds .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and try to explore the boundaries of the possible track .
and my love to reflect fiction fiction in my neighborhood , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep .
jacques cousteau came inside our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world showed us that we could never have before .
and then it &apos;s very good at this <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could draw .
and since it was neither video games nor video games with <unk> , the whole imagery had to make the landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at all . if we were to read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them onto our canvas .
my response to that was this drawing and drawing from aliens , aliens , <unk> , and all of this stuff .
in the <unk> , i was caught in the teacher &apos;s time when i was hidden , in the field of textbook .
the creativity had to get out .
and something interesting happened , because what struck me about jacques <unk> shows , was the thought that was a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i certainly would never do that in a space with a spaceship , and that seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on the earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all of the things that i &apos;ve been imagined on , when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided .
the only problem with me was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t get frustrated from that .
i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , found out exactly on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , though , a real ocean , i just got two years later when we moved to california .
since then , over the 40 years , that &apos;s been <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , how we really hardly can imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know the limits , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
for today , i seem deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding on , the same intensity as ever .
then , as an adult , it was a profession that was <unk> .
that seemed the best way to get my inner ability to connect stories , to unite .
as a child , i drew the constantly <unk> and this way .
so , films of the way were to bring pictures and stories together . this fit .
of course , the stories i &apos;ve been to <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; aliens . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to combine my <unk> for the <unk> and connect with the <unk> .
so , basically my two loves .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , back .
and the first thing that came out was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever seen in a movie .
it was a film that didn &apos;t make money , exactly , he just played his <unk> , but i realized something fascinating : the audience was like <unk> from the magic , which went out of it .
according to arthur ezra , the law is <unk> technology and magic to be different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that i found an incredibly exciting .
and i was like , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what it has to be involved in <unk> . &quot;
so we went , &quot; you know , we &apos;re <unk> , &quot; a lot more on .
along with <unk> created this guy from liquid metal , the success hanging from the effect was going to come .
and it worked . again , we had created a magical thing , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit of more money on the movie .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity for creativity .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan <unk> , who was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> . she called &quot; digitally <unk> . &quot;
so the basic idea of this company was that the phase of analog processes with visual processing , etc . , etc .
and then we did , and then we took a competitive advantage for a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> , which we actually created the company in the <unk> .
but the bar pushed up quite nicely , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
so i shifted that and made this other movie about the big ship .
i was selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . it was an <unk> scale , a passionate movie .
but i wanted to actually <unk> the real <unk> of titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the movie .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we go up to the <unk> . we go up to the <unk> . we &apos;re the real <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to mind that the imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality six months later , in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and my real titanic , the real titanic .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that blew my mind .
and the amount of preparation that is enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and everything .
and i noticed how much of these <unk> , like a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up to those capsule , you &apos;re floating in these dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is going to be saved , if you don &apos;t make it even back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
and anyway , by the way , with curiosity and science , it was . it was all . it was . it was a curiosity .
and it was an experience that hollywood can &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
so , this has really got me <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to <unk> , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took small robots that we had built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look at <unk> and the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one has ever been the inside of the <unk> exploration . you didn &apos;t have any tools for it . so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting there on the deck of titanic , in a <unk> , and seeing <unk> that are pretty similar , and i know that once you &apos;ve played the band of the titanic .
and i &apos;m going to fly a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s actually just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically present in the titanic of the titanic .
and the set was quite a copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize that you can use such <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s how consciousness can move into the vehicle in that other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound deeply profound .
and perhaps a little view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
after that expeditions , we began what we saw at the bottom of that , really appreciate learning , for example , these <unk> , where we saw this amazing amazing animals -- that &apos;s kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a very much legal system , as we do .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in <unk> , which was again , the <unk> from my childhood .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out on the end of the time that i took out in the deep sea .
we were living rooms , but actually , in fact , science , we were told .
so , the circle , between my existence , as a <unk> , then as a kid , and the implementation of reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got to be a director , you know , a leader or something .
but i don &apos;t have a lot of leadership before i get there .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> films make us no money .
we just play the <unk> one . we &apos;re not a host of fame .
all thinking , i &apos;m between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> and &quot; avatar &quot; is <unk> somewhere on one towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all made these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , sometimes we have been two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you can have , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i got back back to my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to make the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re being respected , and in return to the <unk> .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain . we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
very exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we were for a four and a half years of a four and a half years .
so , my way of doing that was to make films completely .
there were people who said that we were going to have these <unk> really well <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
to me , it was more like a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get out of all that ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think first of all , is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the alarm on your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmakers , they say , &quot; give me a advice to me like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; not even one .
it &apos;s all for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet on yourself , not to yourself . &quot;
nasa has such an opportunity to say , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and in studying failure , failure has to be an alternative , because there will be a <unk> .
not an important endeavor called innovation , the without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you the way . failure is an alternative , fear but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and that might surprise you , because my <unk> is mostly in the foundation to make vaccines and seeds to do the things that we create and provide the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate change are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing . it &apos;s too much rain to rain . things are going to change the way it doesn &apos;t sustain their fragile environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the <unk> is very important for them .
in fact , if you could reduce it from one thing , if you could reduce the price of energy to the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like the time of time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a strong case in the <unk> , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air <unk> , and therefore we can make modern materials .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price -- let &apos;s make a new barrier , and we put this barrier to co2 .
co2 heats the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are that there are some of the ideas , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly a ambiguity of how bad that will be , but they &apos;re extremely bad .
so i asked the <unk> multiple times , &quot; we really have to get down to zero ?
isn &apos;t that enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes further .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 meter of high truck , which is under a meter of bridge , and then you can kind of <unk> it underneath .
this is up to zero .
well , we <unk> a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people of poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create change that can cut it down to zero .
it has gone up now .
only different economic changes in it , and we need to be able to use <unk> increase in reducing , and we have to grow up to a reduction .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of individuals and think about how we get to zero .
probably one needs to come very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today &apos;s life billion .
and it turns out to be nine billion <unk> on 9 billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> may be able to get this 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a slope by 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes everything , the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> , which means that they &apos;re almost all available on the planet .
it &apos;s a great thing going up .
here we see a very basic service , is there at home with a very basic service to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally there good news .
we have something that is not rising .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other ways of <unk> , through new methods in the <unk> , there are many services in their energy by 90 percent .
in other services , like making <unk> , 105 flights : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction in three or a factor even six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re going to go from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion pounds , and that &apos;s simply not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit .
it turns out to be a zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every stroke of electricity , these days , co2 levels are co2 , except renewables .
so , what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the wonders , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to a lot of this miracle .
usually there is no <unk> that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just going to stand up and get some , others don &apos;t .
but in this case , we need to get <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i actually deliver that ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that the idea of people &apos;s vision ?
i remembered the last year when i got mosquitoes , and somehow people liked it .
the idea was really , really , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is one .
so i decided that this would let me let my <unk> work on the environment .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
i told me they don &apos;t bite you . you &apos;re not going to bite the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot of them .
we need to get solutions , either one or multiple <unk> , and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many ways people are looking for after it , i really only see five demands .
i &apos;ve left out , <unk> , fusion , fusion and biofuels left out .
let &apos;s first take fossil fuels to burning fossil fuels of either coal or gas .
who will make sure ?
who can do something like that , literally , many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough part .
next , <unk> .
then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not big , it &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and they &apos;re going to be soluble to work .
the last three of the five ones i &apos;ve summarized .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called in renewables .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some <unk> .
one is the energy density that these technologies create dramatically less than electricity .
these are <unk> , you talk from a lot , a thousand times more powerful than a normal power plant .
and then these sources of <unk> are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem all the day , and the wind will not go all the time .
and so you have to , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to get the energy also , if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great <unk> here . there are challenges in the transmission , if we say , for example , that the energy source outside of the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also need to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 , than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over 20 percent of the rest of the rest of us .
if you want to rely on 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where are we supposed to go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project , &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are many companies working on it . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people who already have engaged in it .
bill gross big companies , among other words , has been a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies that are doing great things and what i &apos;m trying to do .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company , which is maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time ago , so there &apos;s no great surprise that there &apos;s some good concepts .
and the <unk> means that instead of one of the <unk> , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors .
rather than break it off , they burn it . just a great thing .
the uranium is being used gradually , a bit like a candle .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; traveling as &quot; like traveling . &quot;
that really solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a place in kentucky .
this is the 99 percent of the waste , the 99 percent , which is incinerated , which is <unk> uranium .
that drives the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you were <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are still many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should be measuring our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , as well as a lot of agriculture , and hopefully be clean and cement .
so , in order to achieve that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , is completely <unk> .
the other grade says we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is great important .
this is going to be a key feature .
if we go back from there , how should we look at the 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to reduce reduction in the way , the less we &apos;re going to be , the less <unk> , and also the temperature .
we have to pursue these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure this thing , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore wrote the book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> the hot air crash .
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed by the wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
this is a wish .
a very active wish we invent this technology .
this has the largest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to use for more data research .
when countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk these <unk> , and they &apos;d be shocked by the ridiculous few funds that are being spent on innovative approaches to these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> &amp; amp ; d <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to get dialogue and full of full , and also the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first of all , you can give us an idea of scale ?
the tricky step is the building of the first <unk> , to find more billion , which is <unk> , and the place that is actually building it .
once the first thing is , when it &apos;s done , it &apos;s all clear , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is so different as we know it .
and to try to understand this , which means to build deep up into the floor , almost like a vertical column , and then it starts the process , and then moving on up ?
<unk> : right . now , today , you have to <unk> the reactor and you have a lot of people who can go wrong . this thing is not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think about a column -- you think it &apos;s buried without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
one of the things that offers a solution to the garbage is .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit there -- there are much less garbage with this method -- then they take him and put him in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in the waste that &apos;s already in these <unk> or <unk> , which is our <unk> .
so what these reactors have was a problem of what we put in our fill , and it &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the amount of time during this process .
but during different people , this world has spoken to the other world .
where is the greatest interest in doing this ?
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a variant of something that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster , and some countries have built this building , so everybody who has done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and more likely to call this life ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years to apply .
this is the kind of <unk> that we have to show us the <unk> that we have to do .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could that easily hold .
and fortunately today , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , and we need hundreds of companies , the way their approaches can work for competing pilots for their pilot , <unk> for it .
and it would be best if it could create several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
<unk> of great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
that would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s more important .
in the nuclear sector , other innovative companies are .
you know , we know whose work doesn &apos;t be as good as these , but there &apos;s the modular method that is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems a little difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what it seems about us .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come in this situation , it &apos;s like eating too much , and it &apos;s just a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is called the model of various techniques to delay warming to <unk> and 30 years for 30 years .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you know , not only do you work on insurance because you might be going to eat a little bit that you &apos;re going to eat , because you know you &apos;re going to save one of the <unk> .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince them ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there &apos;s negative impacts to do with the clouds that are moving things out ?
there are very , very few things that you can even say , by which there is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for that much later .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about us .
<unk> : well , the actual spending on research -- we say the u.s. to spend 10 billion per year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t be suffering .
you get to <unk> , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that , for me , most of the food waste is happening .
because , you know , you &apos;re very shortly before a <unk> and funded only the learning curve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much more expensive .
if the <unk> that you get , you can only get the rich .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much as our energy without changing the lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> think .
his new <unk> now is , &quot; why don &apos;t we talk more about it ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s now getting the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little support is going to be .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all of the people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is to be true . many , thank you .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . <unk> , the highest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about 20 spaghetti tape , about three feet , about a meter .
the marshmallow is up to it .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work , because it drives people very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
most usually , most people start to orient on to orient .
they talk about it , what they &apos;re going to look like , they &apos;re <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they &apos;re <unk> .
they spend most of their time in the <unk> <unk> structures constantly .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time anymore , somebody put the marshmallow and you put them carefully on the top , step one step back , and then you admire them .
but then , what &apos;s going on , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; becomes a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow doesn &apos;t affect the <unk> that the whole thing will be .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> than others , and under the worst are fresh water <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really confused .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and under the best they have fresh graduate students in the world .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t produce only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , what is this ? why ? what ? what about that ?
and peter tells , &quot; no one &apos;s kids doing it in the head of spaghetti <unk> .
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar what ?
what &apos;s <unk> different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes always on the top of the marshmallow , so that they can <unk> the possibility of fixing prototypes .
<unk> can recognize this kind of collaboration as a nucleus <unk> .
and with every trial , the children is immediate feedback , which works not .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but look at how different teams are doing .
the average for most people lies on about <unk> , <unk> half of them , but not much more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
three feet , the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to making stable structures .
ceos are something about average . but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator on the team , you will significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you can see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and that team , that <unk> , and looking at the work is going to make the performance greater .
these specialized skills and <unk> skills and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that have the typical approach , you get about six who have stable structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
and i thought , let &apos;s bring it the same way .
so i offered a $ <unk> cost software to the winners .
what happened to this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone could have built high apparatus , he would have carried home the price .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high pressure has a strong effect ?
we went through this exercise with the same students .
so what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
this is the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the end .
so there &apos;s <unk> lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
you might wonder : why would somebody invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;ll help digital tools and processes to help get teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is it helps to identify them hidden .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a shared experience , and a common language , or a stance , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in you can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of the world as people like the system <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually the construction of a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses into the task , and we think we &apos;re using our thinking optimal , how our feelings and what do we do in the challenge is that we are in the challenge .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that needs to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we have a machine that we have here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everybody in this room must .
and you can go into the past , you can &apos;t go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i often ask my friends in last time , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or america or america .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m in a sense that you somehow are drawn to the <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s not going to go back on this planet , and go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that it ever gave on this planet , no matter what scale you can do : health , wealth , mobility , declining declining .
there was never time before that .
my <unk> died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents encouraged this number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born today in new delhi &apos;s life as long as the richest man in the world is 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox , smallpox , billions of people killed on this planet .
they have formed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever been done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . pop !
in the rich world , there are diseases that have <unk> millions of us just threatened by one generation in front of us .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billion people , are the successes of the scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method to try to look at things , see if it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s changing , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve mentioned a lot of other problems , and they &apos;ve mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in the world are going hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes up very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> land , rainforests , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , soon , and if we don &apos;t from this chaos of chaos , we go away .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think that .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which is billions of people to feed , not to rape .
i think we can power this world that doesn &apos;t destroy them at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m awake at night . we haven &apos;t really <unk> scientific progress .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it , as we can , as we can now .
people <unk> out in their faith , and so they can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth gets it .
and listen , everybody has a right to be in his opinion ; even a right on his opinion , to make progress .
but do you know where you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at <unk> , to <unk> resistance , which is at the end of the most effective activity in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always want to do , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically transformed food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve got an article written about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they thought that molecules would be a certain kind of <unk> <unk> a random way of being a random kind of <unk> .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but that article was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found out .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> were not <unk> me at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that was so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as early .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we talk about it , with little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons for that , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have faith in the institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , weapons , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed they were always right . so they &apos;re skeptical .
ask , ask you , desire the evidence , desire .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s : if you have to get this evidence , you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell you that we are now in an epidemic of fear now , as i &apos;ve never seen them , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that was <unk> with measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine combined .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that was true .
lots of studies have been done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we think we think we &apos;re seeing , what makes us feel like we &apos;re real .
we don &apos;t think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
a devastating fact is , the united states is one of the only countries in the world that <unk> the <unk> for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody got measles ?
has one one in the audience in the audience at <unk> ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
well , in this country at all , but in 2003 , in the last year , in the last year .
these are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny , and it &apos;s <unk> of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can &apos;t connect , because they don &apos;t connect to connection and correlation .
they don &apos;t seem to be the same thing that these things seem right , but almost never .
and this is something that we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s developed with a few other people a <unk> .
he can save more life a year in the developing world in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , this is good , apart from the fact that paul <unk> and vaccines about vaccines , and it says that people should just stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so , paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks to a public <unk> , he can &apos;t talk <unk> <unk> .
he gets phone calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children are going to school to school .
and why ? because paul has done vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that vaccines are essential .
take them on , return the diseases , the horrible disease , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;ve got measles now .
and that becomes worse , and pretty soon , children will die back to it , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t get her kid against <unk> <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning somebody in lagos &apos;s morning in a plane , and fly to los angeles , right now , to los angeles .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to come up with one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to put it in lies . we love that .
did you all put your vitamins in this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to get on the <unk> .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half the americans are doing it every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they useless .
that &apos;s the data all the time .
they make their urine . they &apos;re never going to do it .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should be , too .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us and <unk> ourselves that can afford it .
so we walk out before , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re going to walk into the arms of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that &apos;s really serious because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of it -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , fraud , that i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people go and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people what you want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which is saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to do the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who want his patient to treat <unk> .
if you &apos;re on that path , where believe in , it &apos;s going to replace the magic of evidence and replace it , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 to 400,000 people , because he passed away that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have the consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the <unk> epidemic , where we &apos;re in , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically engineered food and the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every branch , every branch of <unk> , every branch of people changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we did it in the last eleven years .
and some of them didn &apos;t work and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve got rid of what worked out .
now we can make it more specific . and of course , there &apos;s risks in rice , but we can do something about vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we are <unk> <unk> .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields that are wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want companies to own those companies .
and you know what my answer to all that is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , the science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow the science to do , because we &apos;re afraid to do a <unk> , and it holds millions of people out of the flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this is the investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ?
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that half billion people eat .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve starve , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about the ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , 10,000 food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time of understanding what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing that , we &apos;re guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s selfish ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after that incredibly funny entertainment conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go back to this ridiculous time machine and in the future ? &quot;
definitely . that &apos;s what i want to do .
in the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to move them , and we will move they where we want .
we need to lead that conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up into the machine time and go into the future we &apos;ll be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as the world needs now , it &apos;s going to take the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
a deception will true to something , because somebody who perceives it .
and so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in any <unk> for children .
i myself have learned him from <unk> <unk> magic <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife they can study , my hand that they can examine .
i &apos;m just going to get the knife in my <unk> .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve , it &apos;s coming out of him , i &apos;ll just get my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that doesn &apos;t happen at any time , as long as i can here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal here is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife is held by my bare physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so <unk> in its place that i can shake it , without even the knife .
nothing moves in my sleeve or come out , no <unk> . and you can examine everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> young children who are really interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simplistic trick .
many of you probably know this trick in the room .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m my wrist <unk> to make sure nothing in my sleeve , or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i think my wrist <unk> is that it &apos;s the secret of the illusion .
because at the moment , where i &apos;m my hand of them , they &apos;re going to look at them from the back of the back , so this finger here , my <unk> , simply from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back sitting there .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m <unk> , the finger changes its position .
but this is actually not about this , and then i open up my hand .
of course , it &apos;s <unk> , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , that &apos;s where it &apos;s there .
and if i &apos;ll close my hand , the same thing happens by me , it &apos;s being hidden through this movement that the fingers <unk> over again .
i &apos;ll take away that hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
that trick you with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
one year ago , i read a study that really blew me out .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
it turns out that , if you offer a placebo agent in a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you &apos;re going to give a <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and these blue color , and a letter to it is actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of these pharmaceutical facilities are just <unk> .
but a <unk> pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out .
it turns out that it &apos;s not all about it .
when you take <unk> , it &apos;s more effective than any pills .
a colored capsule that &apos;s on a end yellow , and the other red one is better than a red capsule .
the dose is also playing a role .
a pill twice a day , not as good pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , &quot; ...
... that &apos;s a role in play .
and the form plays a role .
and if you want to make the ultimate ultimate , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you inject patients .
this creates a very strong image in the head . that &apos;s a lot more than a white pill .
this chart is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another one of them , if we have a projector .
so , in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t seem so good like the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem so good like the capsule of a capsule that acts as good as the needle .
and none of it really has a really <unk> property . it &apos;s only our belief that we can make a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to the needle when it &apos;s going to go to the point .
this is an 18 inches long time . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of <unk> .
this is really my meat , it &apos;s not <unk> special <unk> of meat .
this is my skin . this is not a effect of hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and go through through it until you put it on the other side .
if you make fun , if you cut away -- i have a couple of friends last night in hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman &apos;s almost <unk> .
so , i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re going to get severe , then you look away for the next 30 seconds , or you know , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it , you can also see , but if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do this crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin , and on the other side .
now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had the same thing called the <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> itself , even the skin , just for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t really seen this . &quot;
the people in the <unk> come in now .
let me show you from that nearby .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
sorry . if you make fun , look away , look away , don &apos;t look .
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , it &apos;s .
so i would normally take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context here and with purpose , from a deception , something real , i &apos;m going to just leave you there , and i &apos;m going to go on the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a couple more days .
i hope you &apos;re very happy . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people on the number of books that have been released with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in the interest in researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these <unk> of work , there are several cognitive areas that are going to be almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly going to fall from that cognitive act .
this is the terms of terms of terms of your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are very confused at the same way that everybody else is like .
the first one is a <unk> , which is a <unk> of complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain significance that we could narrow it down , but in the big and large , this is something we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a phrase from experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s been between happiness in his life and happy to be happy with his life or happiness with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the imagination of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the miserable fact that we can &apos;t think about the fact that we can &apos;t think about the situation that affects its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and then he added it , really quite emotionally , that has the entire experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruins were the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
it didn &apos;t matter because he was <unk> with a reminder ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what it really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and think about other people in the sense of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , capable of experiencing the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m here ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units of units , the <unk> self , and the <unk> themselves , and the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that starts really with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts instantly .
we &apos;re not just telling stories , if we do it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we need to keep in our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients in a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s no painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they asked them , &quot; who of them have suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has been suffering more clearly . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients think that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a much worse person had <unk> to the <unk> than the patient has been b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clearly ...
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the worse that it was worse where the pain was at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to ask , &quot; well , how much was the whole thing that was overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse than a b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the perspective of self , b has clearly had an awful time .
that will lead to that patient , but just a little bit less and much less than before .
so what makes a story out ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make us memory , and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
so what a story <unk> is , is <unk> , significant moments and end .
and end is very , very important and very , very important in this case .
now , the <unk> self lives his life continuously .
it &apos;s got moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
most of them are completely ignored by themselves .
and yet , you somehow get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of the <unk> of our life .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we consume while we are in this world .
and as we use it , it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that &apos;s keeping the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal of time .
from the point of view itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week , it &apos;s as good as the first week , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> self , that &apos;s a <unk> vacation , hardly better at vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , in fact , the critical variable that is very different from a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> self . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remembering and to tell stories .
the <unk> itself has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose to do between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future , as memories of an memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self , and you can think of yourself as a <unk> self as one , which is sort of the <unk> itself by experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we do this very often , that &apos;s a very common case , which is called , largely , in the service of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a bit of justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the <unk> itself .
and i would probably journey from my memories of this <unk> journey , and i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the folder , i would have spent another hour in it .
well , these are three weeks , and it &apos;s only a half a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of <unk> all their images , and you get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
why we choose the <unk> that we choose to do with a choice between the two of themselves .
now , the two ways of self throwing two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are these moments in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a rather complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness for itself .
if you ask for the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy that person is to think about your life .
very different term .
and everyone who doesn &apos;t get these terms to <unk> the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a bunch of researchers about well-being that we &apos;ve made a lot of things that these happiness have .
the distinction between happiness of happiness itself , and the happiness of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a survey , where more than half a million people have been asking questions about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there are other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about happiness in the last few years .
and the main lesson we learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and it teaches them not a lot of how happy he lives , how happy he lives and the other .
just to give you a sense of correlation that has about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about its scale ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has his life as eight , you have a lot of uncertainty about it , how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness performance is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but it &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re trying to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;ll see very different things at the end of the self .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we should really &apos;t think about happiness as a replacement to be .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t understand happiness is that we &apos;re not focusing on the same thing when we think about life , and when we actually think about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are , you don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think about this question , you know , people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people could get to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are going to california , to become happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is , you &apos;re going to think , you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , how terrible the weather was in ohio . and you &apos;re feeling the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we spoke to a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting result that there was a pretty interesting outcome out of this .
is this something that you can share with you , because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result , which we found in the <unk> survey , is a number that we have anticipated survey .
we found that in terms of happiness for itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 dollars , but it &apos;s a very large sample , under one income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , they become poorer .
that &apos;s a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
now , what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t buy money , but that lack of money to give money to an certainly <unk> , and we can do this misery very , very clearly .
in the spirit of self , the <unk> self , getting another story .
you make the more money you make the happier .
this is not for emotions .
but danny , the whole american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take these <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to look like everything we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians would say that the country generally would take a <unk> , like seriously taking on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition of recognition in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k , it &apos;s happening in the united kingdom .
people are , acknowledge , that they should think of happiness , when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study <unk> , or have to study it , so we need to study this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness in a very different way , about how they think , and whether they think they think about the <unk> themselves .
this will affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you get to measure the <unk> of the population .
that will be , i think , in the next one or two decades , i think it will be part of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me that it &apos;s going to be the theme , or should at least be the most exciting political debate over the next few years .
thank you for behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m thriving <unk> . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing this for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , like to save in <unk> .
i &apos;ve got a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , more time playing is greater and more <unk> games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week per week .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; well , that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we need in the real world &apos;s real world .
but actually , in fact , my research at the center for the future is actually the opposite to the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most world &apos;s most powerful .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase it dramatically .
i calculated that the required time of 21 billion hours just <unk> a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite why i believe that games are so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of <unk> phil .
he wanted to capture the feelings in games . so he was building a camera on the players .
this is one of the classical expressions in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might get some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably looking at this sense of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , a <unk> in a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , which is <unk> eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
this is a player who &apos;s on the verge called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive that they didn &apos;t know before , that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked , that they &apos;re actually capable of doing this . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player is just a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to do in millions of faces all over the world , if we &apos;re going to take the barriers of the next century in attack on the edge of the next century , face the face of the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult issues .
and i call it the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m living that &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis in my thesis for why we &apos;re in play better than in real life .
this is a problem that has a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not so good at reality in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less than that , even though that belongs .
we &apos;re doing more in <unk> . i mean , i &apos;m good at doing something about motivation , inspired to work together .
and in reality , if we run out of failure , we often feel different , we &apos;re often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , they don &apos;t play it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in play , thinking , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we put these feelings out of play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal setting to the communal environment problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some of the things that are epic <unk> in <unk> .
well , first of all , if you &apos;re in one of these <unk> , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to be willing to give you a <unk> mission , and that immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at their current level , right ?
so they can do that .
they never get a task to solve them .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to work together , but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re <unk> . there &apos;s always a thing to target .
and there are tons of employees .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them work to work to work their epic mission .
this is what we don &apos;t have in real life , that feeling , that in a very small amount of employees , there are tons of staff .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve certainly heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 <unk> , &quot; or &quot; + 1 <unk> . &quot;
this constant feedback is not true in true life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + 1 , and + a crazy idea , 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in true life .
so , the problem of warcraft like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to any time at any given at any given time , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so today , all the world of <unk> has spent <unk> million years to solve virtual problems to solve virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in the context of the context of <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go upright .
so , the first upright primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we &apos;re currently playing with games , it &apos;s just meaning when you &apos;re in the order of the human development in the human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this all the time to play this whole time on playing , actually , what we &apos;re doing as human beings .
we &apos;re going to develop ourselves in collaborative thinking .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe i .
take a look at this interesting statistic , which was recently published by a researcher carnegie university : the average young man today in a country with strong <unk> spends 10,000 hours to the 21st of year .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours is the exact <unk> that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> here , on the young people , as well as it means to be a good player , like everything else , what they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours of what any of the most significant studies for the 21st of year , we &apos;re going to do it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the players &apos;s players ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to have the potential of having potential .
so many people have been doing so far in the world that &apos;s at least one hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary to be in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are remarkably good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed process of saving energy and working on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so that players can play online in the whole world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total of a billion players .
so i started to think , what it is , what it &apos;s doing for us to master these games .
here &apos;s the 4 things that i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do some immediately , a piece of a barrier , with the belief that we have hope to succeed .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth it , and it &apos;s worth it , and it &apos;s the same .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in <unk> social networking .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies showing that we may have people who are playing with them , even when they defeated us .
the reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust required to play with someone a game .
we trust that someone has spent time with us , that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to stay with the <unk> .
so this allows the <unk> to grow up by bonds , trust and together .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week play , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happy to work hard to work than if we relax or not doing anything .
we know that as human beings , we work as human beings , when we get hard , meaningful work done .
and players are always ready to work hard , when they get the right to work .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it to be a part of awe of <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to put that on the right thing . you know , all wikipedia , the world &apos;s greatest <unk> .
the second largest <unk> in the world , almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other <unk> in the internet than any other <unk> in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who are just leading to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is you believe you can change virtual worlds , but not the real stuff .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much energy , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not seen a witness in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is from an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not as i do -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense , actually , because players can do more in <unk> than in real life .
they can actually make stronger social bonds than in the real life , they get more feedback and rewards in games as in the real life .
so he says , it &apos;s completely logical right that gamers more time in virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
there were these fantastic <unk> <unk> .
and that was kind of the first of the people we developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek <unk> , you may be familiar with this story . the story of about how and why games were invented .
according to games , games were <unk> , more precise , in the kingdom of <unk> during a famine .
and there was such a great famine that decided that the king of the <unk> decided to have a crazy idea .
people were fighting . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it was an extreme solution .
so , they invented a national strategy called <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . one day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , and they would be so fascinating and we were with <unk> , <unk> productivity , surrounded productivity , that they had nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived so 18 years by using a day , and they were playing on a day .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape suffering from the suffering of the physical world .
we put games in order to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all the real life , and we get what we need to do .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better not better . so , the king , the last <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a <unk> , and the best people were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and went to search for a new home . they just had so many people to go back to survive , and they were looking at the rest of a neighborhood where they were able to thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which is later the roman empire , which is the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , scientists recently came to the notion that the crazy story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> organization that took nearly 20 years of what the famine might explain .
so this might be voices .
you may actually have saved their people through playing through playing for 18 years , and then they had these 18 years of games , and then they had these <unk> , and then they learned so much about this civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been warcraft in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in real time , which was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been warcraft for 16 years .
i claim we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of the civilization on the search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should have been <unk> that half of us a day spend an hour playing with play , until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the question i &apos;ve been working on in the last years for the future .
we &apos;ve got this flag in palo alto , in palo alto , like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to think of the best possible outcome , and then empower people to make this sense of reality .
we set ourselves <unk> , and giving people the opportunities to reach them .
so i &apos;m going to show you three games that i designed to try to make , to try and make people epic by epic .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you &apos;ve got to overcome a <unk> .
we have tested this game with 9,000 players in 2007 . and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
no one wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , you &apos;re going to get the oil . &quot;
this is one fascinating adventure to be on .
and find out how they would survive , most of our players have these <unk> habits .
so we &apos;ve got to play a bigger game for the next <unk> game as just as <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the future .
now , the calculation is the calculation of a <unk> , that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you know , the call to players at some players , we &apos;ve made a <unk> .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s the <unk> . they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together they can save the world .
8,000 players playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 very creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re <unk> .
and the last game we get on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank response , the award for &quot; social <unk> , &quot; degree in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa and store them , social redesign .
we have a comic book to do . we have a comic book to be understood , <unk> , sustainability , vision and imagination .
i would invite you all to share this game with young people , all around the world , particularly in <unk> that benefits to us , to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;ll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have not saved the world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that play a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit close nets , <unk> , and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play major games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you will design with me like this and design .
if i &apos;m going to go into the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things : that we can create any <unk> future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so , i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what a few months ago in writing a article for wired wired magazine .
i always got my <unk> at the end of the day , but i was working with the record of the text already , and i noticed that i had never done in my life in my life .
i &apos;ll read you the point .
<unk> : healthy , powerful , powerful .
of course , it was a <unk> , old <unk> . i was just thinking that the output must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i was working with the elementary school and started to form my sense of self outside my family and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use <unk> .
if i was in a way seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me to perceive as a person who is living in any way possible , but today , i &apos;m going to celebrated for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately said to myself the <unk> of 2009 , and expecting me to be a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she isn &apos;t much better .
in particular , the last two words in the last pair of words &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with this words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the <unk> societies , including the greeks and the <unk> , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> is a big force , because what you can do is also <unk> .
so , what do we really want to do -- one disabled person or a powerful people ?
you can do a human being <unk> as a child , just <unk> , <unk> and giving you beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
one person who opened for me was my pediatrician at the <unk> glorious institute in <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name was , as you can think , most americans could not be correct , and so he was called dr. <unk> .
and dr. prince had always been very colorful , and was for work with kids just like created .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even been able to negotiate with dr. la <unk> , and so i tried to stop this practice , <unk> without success .
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to ask myself today , like his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls , and i could imagine myself , as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and <unk> person .
this is just an example of a lot of how adults can make the imagination a child .
but as a result of <unk> examples , we don &apos;t let our language make a difference , to imagine what we would all wish to do : it &apos;s every single way to allow ourselves to see itself .
our language <unk> the societal change in the social change behind a technological change .
so perhaps it shows this technological change , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every human being on society is able to be very powerful and very powerful , and the human ability to adapt our <unk> .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re changing from the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i claim that that is good .
<unk> are not a obstacle , which we need to get <unk> to live with our lives .
<unk> are just among our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact of , not the impact of the <unk> of a human being .
there are <unk> in life , and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and every person is working on it , but the question is not whether we come with <unk> , or not , but how we &apos;re clear to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people who we love to preserve , but they &apos;re ready to get ready for sure .
and we don &apos;t really like our kids , if we give them a feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things out of that , to be a <unk> in the fact , and to the other of the social opinion that i &apos;m disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only thing that i had to put in it is that i had to put apart , that the world is constantly saying , she can describe me with that definitions .
maybe the current concept , which is just to look at what &apos;s in a break , and how we fix that , for every single a greater disability than the <unk> itself .
if we don &apos;t overcome a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities and acknowledge and acknowledge , we &apos;re going to have to fight to the natural fight that you might have to have , another disease .
we <unk> people who have value for our society .
so we have to focus on the <unk> and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our flaws and our great <unk> .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to do these <unk> times or denial , we should not try to avoid them , to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see in the <unk> opportunities .
it may be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but we &apos;re open for it , you know , you &apos;re a hug , you know , you &apos;re going to give a hug , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> as something natural , <unk> and useful to see us as their presence as a presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday , darwin , and when he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin , in my mind , has been noted in the human character .
i would like to use it , not the most powerful of its way , and also not the <unk> of its way , but the way that can adapt to the best changes .
it &apos;s generated conflicts .
not just from darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability of the people to survive and survive , from the fight of the human spirit is determined by conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of humans .
and maybe we only know what timber is about , if we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the point of <unk> , a perceptions of that -- a sense of our own force .
we can give us something like this .
we can give a new meaning to a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are a change where we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s the usual question . the typical one , but not the normal , and would you know that the ordinary person really wants to learn , if they were really ?
i think rather not .
<unk> , we found out that we have always been useful in the members of our society : useful to be useful and a contribution .
there are evidence that people have been hearing about 60,000 years ago , and people with severe physical injuries with <unk> injuries , and perhaps that , because the experience of life is precious .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were considered something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went in the city in which i grew up in a <unk> zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee &apos;s mullins . &quot;
and i look around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i was pulled out of her belly .
oh , so that .
and then , of course , it did it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i only knew from my mother &apos;s narratives on this day because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> my mother was on vacation , so my parents knew the guy who brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born with no <unk> , and my feet had been looking at them , and i just had some toes on this and a few toes in the other foot , and it had to be the <unk> of the bad news .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how crucial that is to be a human being .
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis was diagnosis , and as someone knows about it , two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my way in the course of time when you asked me about the age of 15 , whether i would have my prostheses against legs and bone <unk> , then i would have no second <unk> .
i wanted to be normal at that time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened my doors rather than meeting people that affect me or i wanted an idea .
see , it really requires a human being , showing you how they can demonstrate their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own , inner forces -- -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you have a very good teacher to open up for these people , a very good teacher .
they teach them to open doors .
the actual meaning of the <unk> is called <unk> in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something to produce something that has potential to do .
again , what the potential is we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k , they were transformed in <unk> . they were transformed in <unk> .
they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are divided by grades .
and a student <unk> <unk> , getting a better teachers , and so on .
they have been talking about a <unk> period with a &quot; good &quot; note with a &quot; good &quot; note . it was told them , they were <unk> , they were very smart , and after these three months they were really <unk> .
and of course , there &apos;s a heart , of course , that vice versa said the <unk> were told .
and then it was the three months after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- besides the students who had <unk> school .
at this point , the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that are the <unk> and that are the students enough with the note enough , and they have taught them something and treated them .
the only disability is a broken mind , a mind that was broken , has no hope anymore . he doesn &apos;t find any more <unk> of imagination , <unk> <unk> and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we do it to help the human spirit to hope , to hope , even more and other people around it , curious and other people are going to be beautiful , curious and <unk> .
if a mind itself has these qualities , we can actually create a new reality and create new <unk> .
come dance with me . thank you very much .
how would they want to be better than they are right now ?
suppose i said that by a few changes of genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more specific and faster .
or do you want to be more powerful , stronger , more force .
would you like to be more attractive and more attractive ?
how longer is it to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who has always been over to more creativity .
which one would you like most ?
which one would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
so , a few . probably , about how many people there are creative people .
it &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world .
is that just fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here on the ted conference , but today , i want to give you a second point of a doctor .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also an <unk> in the russian <unk> church , once wrote an essay on the title &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in biology . &quot;
but when you accept biological evolution , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for other people or is it too ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote to share with the other parts of the tree , but in fact , the most fundamental mechanisms are our cells quite equal .
is that clear that we can use it and the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human brain , which is used to produce <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that each of us in our gut is more bacteria than it is in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think about that when antonio damasio says , you think about the bacteria ?
and our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only be without a endeavor .
it &apos;s a really easier way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> , forced power .
but , you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help <unk> nutrients . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life is just a little bit of a <unk> , the animal kingdom , as a single stroke , and the human life , a small <unk> .
that &apos;s us .
now , this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , d ate it .
now , when i was a college student at college , i had my first <unk> team .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i was in love with something very basic : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information is going to be led into both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms began to change things .
sexual reproduction is <unk> .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is <unk> , the rest of the body <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death in the same way is in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , who read in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door open .
in front of him , a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george , i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to a doctor , as a doctor , that i was a goal of thinking differently than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to restore health to a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about reducing the genome from the genome to the next generation , adaptation , and survival generation .
so , from an evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s , you know , how <unk> rockets are designed to send the genetic <unk> to the orbit of the orbit to the sea .
i think we would all think of the mood that woody allen has to be understood when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i &apos;m not going to die by going . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
in the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are present to the <unk> , and by the hot steam , if fish were there , it would have eaten a vacuum , and they were able to have a <unk> environment for themselves .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that , first of all , is that we &apos;ve had a lot of genes , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise <unk> and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of the way that we have the environment that we &apos;ve done , that we &apos;ve been able to adapt it to us precisely , and we adapt to them to adapt to us .
and by the way , we go and <unk> and <unk> us so much that they can &apos;t say more than to say that isolation , for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that there &apos;s a evolution of traditional way to be , of course , imposed from nature of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels , the evolution of evolution , but it &apos;s participation .
and so far the isolation is going to be <unk> as a species distance , it will insulation isolation and change the environment in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> option , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development is not just natural , but led by us as a <unk> in the choices we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
let &apos;s see the reality that people are doing today , in certain cultures , making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , to have a choice to have more men as women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so , think about that if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of their child , but also make genetic adaptations , to make the diseases and prevent the disease .
what if they could make the genetic change in order to eradicate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or <unk> to eliminate risk ?
wouldn &apos;t they want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , this kind of changes will be possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and a half of the <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be available for a long time to get the reality that it will give a thousand dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin can generate in bacteria can make viruses that are not just themselves , but also for the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in walking with vaccine for influenza on the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that &apos;s from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and it will be much more possible in the future .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> or the fresh <unk> of egg to children , to give your kids a better chance to save the risk of cancer -- eliminating diabetes , remove the risk of cancer ?
who does not want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can enable the change to prevent disease , could allow us to adopt <unk> , <unk> -- that better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a time that we can pass it on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution for <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires the rule 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that are their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to deal with .
do we use these decisions a society that is better , which is better , which is more successful ?
or are we going to choose selectively attributes , which we want to do for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society <unk> and <unk> , or more powerful , or more <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to address .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom of wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to do to make these decisions ?
good in the good ones in the evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or one another , the <unk> process helps to get up and go back .
at berkeley , we call these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something you can put in the morning and increase additional strength , and it will increase its speed , for example , and to help them make their balance .
this is actually the real <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- so that together , and connect to the universe and others out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers on average , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request for you to carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we were going to think that we would embrace this challenge , and we created a <unk> that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to a <unk> -- or universal human universal .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds above <unk> terrain , for many hours .
his flexible design enables it to get deep down to <unk> and <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and put my strength and resilience up .
we &apos;re so far , we &apos;re going to introduce this device to this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now , let &apos;s look at our attention to the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m very passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s about one percent of all .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about a very young person with spinal cord spinal cord in the height of their life -- &apos; 20s , 30s , &apos; 40s -- the fate were hit , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it also goes to the aging population , the number of multiplied .
and so pretty much the option -- if it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , or about other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , since 500 years , to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the field of mobility .
now , let me introduce you to now , which is amanda <unk> <unk> , who was 19 years ago , who was 19 years ago , who had a result that she couldn &apos;t run over 19 years before and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wears our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals that are <unk> on our <unk> , who is on their backs .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as their <unk> , which they move forward to this fairly <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and i was in <unk> when a <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after that step in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never get again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every most hopeful hope .
so <unk> technologies have been going to come back to me since <unk> , to climb , to rock and drive the hands with the hands .
but nothing was invented me back until now , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for us to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life by future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda here , and every wheelchair here , but for everyone .
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m scared of <unk> of a non-profit called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t have the poverty of poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a volunteer a garden .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers at the <unk> , so i had quite good opportunities in it .
but it was still a race against the other <unk> to reach the people and to find out what would be our tasks .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the <unk> that certainly had one of the worst days of your life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> and <unk> under a screen in the <unk> rain while home in flames .
the other volunteers that came out of this was -- let &apos;s call him moral luther luther -- to get the <unk> king of the first , and was asked to save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was <unk> out .
there was any lawyer or a <unk> , which is now for the rest of his life to tell people that he went to a <unk> house to save a living , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> to me .
he said , &quot; <unk> , you have to go home .
you have to go up to the fire , to the fire , and have to have a pair of shoes . &quot;
i promise it .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down where i put my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put up our goal outside the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , a couple of weeks later , the <unk> letter was a letter <unk> in which they &apos;re <unk> for the brave set of their house .
one of all the numbers estimated kindness : somebody had brought a pair of shoes .
and both in my career in robin hood , as well as in my <unk> as a volunteer , i witnessed generosity and kindness in a large scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room , and you can see people who either have been able to achieve success , or on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in any life until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give it to you .
use them in a park , sit down a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the life of a man , but every day gives us the ability to change one .
so they go out ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human genome .
a place where women do the <unk> lead to sex hi &apos; hello , and the game is determined -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their mating .
this is the wild bonobos in the middle of congo .
bonobos are with chimpanzees our closest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who was about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are familiar with their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the human evolution of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
during the chimps , <unk> boys are being run by <unk> females .
they really come up with something , because that leads to a <unk> society in the deadly violence hasn &apos;t been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known as the primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re very difficult observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent competition for decades and almost so many of life has asked how much world war has been .
it &apos;s not surprising that those destruction are at risk survival to bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> lead to the <unk> that you couldn &apos;t even fill up a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there &apos;s no reason to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know as a &quot; love instead of war , &quot; <unk> , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflicts and social partners .
i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobo &apos;s life made out of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love playing your life .
play is not just <unk> .
and for us , it &apos;s essential to the attachment of the relationships of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we &apos;re learning confidence and the rules of the game .
play with creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity from diversity -- diversity in interactions , diversity in behaviors , diversity in connections .
and when you watch bonobos at play , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique recordings of the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think of <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origins of this : &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
it &apos;s just that i think it &apos;s more likely to be , right .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both for bonobos as well as humans .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of whom are quiet , <unk> , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the wonder .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s <unk> with water .
and i think just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes we have <unk> boundaries of our inner and deep worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us do research and interact , and the unexpected scales that we form are the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos us into our past and present .
but also , it &apos;s a secret to our future for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , more creativity and levels of cooperation .
the secret is the key to these skills of these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we must play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , for bonobos , the lives are not made of teeth and claws alone .
now , if it &apos;s barely appropriate , you might be playing on <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while talking about creativity and <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 at the same moment , at the same moment , every <unk> a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> , a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much of the time to imagine that , because if you &apos;re going to imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
think about it just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case that you &apos;re in a case , the <unk> <unk> is carrying out that x chromosome is <unk> .
and in the other case , the <unk> is one x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hats .
well , under a hat &apos;s hat , i am the anatomy of the anatomy .
i studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that &apos;s the same animal , animal bodies -- how they thought about <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i used to work on my work is the activist , as <unk> -- or as i say sometimes as a <unk> lawyer -- of people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> the social norms in the question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people who have their gender <unk> -- so people who have not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you some examples of the kinds of kinds of <unk> that are not living in male or female standards .
in one case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> gene , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> leaves the <unk> that we &apos;re all going to have , <unk> .
and so the testicles are on the <unk> stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body evolves more to the typical female trend .
if the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes time to take the puberty and grow her breasts and grow their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone comes to a little bit differently .
and they &apos;re going to make some tests and find that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , are <unk> in it , and they &apos;re going to have the y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , have something called a <unk> .
they are in the back of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> hormones , which are the <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> <unk> , but i think i &apos;m probably the typical -- most women -- most women like me are actually talking about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that has more <unk> than a woman who was born with testes , and a woman who has been born with testes .
gender are really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can you be spread all the bandwidth .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> was so active that they &apos;ve created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male gives his <unk> male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had an airplane .
and when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was <unk> at the heart of the time that the doctors found out that he was in a female .
okay , just a quick example of a pattern of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , which means something called <unk> , which is called <unk> by <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- was it <unk> or <unk> twins , was <unk> -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because it would be adapted for their physical health care .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why we &apos;re doing many different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
we typically based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain kind of anatomical value with a certain identity .
so , we have the concept that is to be a woman &apos;s name is called female identity ; one black person is thought to have an african anatomy on their own history .
so we have this terrible idea .
and if we faced a body with a body that &apos;s actually a little bit of a matter of fact , it <unk> us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about makers .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people are born in a body .
where i had experienced most of the big excitement was the most exciting year , <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender have been asked in berlin .
many journalists were calling me the question : &quot; what will you do to say that <unk> <unk> female or male sex ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s this test .
we now know that the gender complicated enough is that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a line between a male and a female and a female and a female and a female and <unk> and female and <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race that turns out to be much more complicated than our <unk> .
in our art , we got into all kinds of <unk> areas .
so , for example , we run into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we are only different from them <unk> ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we continue to move increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we must recognize that the <unk> categories that we have probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
and one of the areas that we see in the <unk> is in our culture today , in the united states today , the fighting and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about where the point to people &apos;s body is so that he has a different right than the kind of <unk> life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as not as publicly as in medicine as in medicine .
our ancestors had never been so hard to struggle with the question of when someone dead died .
and you have someone to miss a feather under the nose , and when she moved , they haven &apos;t been buried yet .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we can take people <unk> organs and put them in other people .
and as a result , as a result , we &apos;re <unk> to the fight with the really hard question when someone dead , and that gets us into a really difficult situation where we didn &apos;t have these simple categories like earlier .
now , you might think that the whole thing would work out of categories like me was really happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit it .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , <unk> .
and it makes me struggle in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i first <unk> that i &apos;m a big fan of the <unk> .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so powerful and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing , i &apos;ve got to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> has happened with the <unk> .
the <unk> were from my view of the original <unk> activists , which is why .
what she <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , that was radical and beautiful for us , and for 200 years .
as you all remember , our <unk> <unk> the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy built on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the ruler of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to do that have to have that political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather &apos;s father and so on .
and the <unk> meadows and meadows and so they were using a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all the people have been created at the same time .
they <unk> the field , and decided that <unk> , the <unk> , the differences , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things were together .
the democracy grew up , but the same time grew up also the science .
if you look at the story of the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , <unk> , meadows things like a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> <unk> of the birthright .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and god of nature .
you &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
you talk from nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they gave us a concept of <unk> commonalities .
and so they &apos;ve prepared a really wonderful way of creating the civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
and women <unk> that .
the next thing came the successful civil rights movement where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> on it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people <unk> different colors that were engaging in anatomical terms of disgust , again , successful color .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start to ask ourselves to ask the question , why we need to sustain certain <unk> .
now , mind , i want to keep in particular , <unk> , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a fish .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be the right to sex , or to get married to married .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make sense of me , and that &apos;s what i think i think is .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we feel it &apos;s good .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , in 1979 , in 1979 the same day .
imagine that one of them , maria , three months was born , so she was born on june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is going to be born to the other side of march , so it &apos;s in march .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months of <unk> was born , you get all sorts of rights before heinrich <unk> , the right to have sex , the right to select the right thing .
heinrich has to go on all these wait , not because he actually has another biological biological , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other parts of what their rights is .
heinrich , you assume that he &apos;s a male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he is with <unk> -- because you assume that he &apos;s a male , he can now be moved in , about which maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
maria , not in all states , can &apos;t be able to see the same thing in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can get married in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science of anatomy is doing that in the anatomy of anatomy , that we have to make a point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s grounded in anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give science , but at the same time sometimes it feels like science itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; good , we need to move anywhere . &quot;
but a lot of people <unk> in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at one point , they decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and one woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested for their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we &apos;re looking at one of the modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us in his &quot; i have a dream to talk .
he says , we shouldn &apos;t ask people to be &quot; your skin , but after the property of your character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do people do because of their <unk> ?
i want to be <unk> , that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions than some <unk> that i know .
so how do we ask the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me , what if the content is something that would be something that would be something that would be done in the future -- through an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to this ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to worry about questions about democracy .
in our commitment to democracy , we were doing really well , and i think we would make our things well in the future .
they don &apos;t exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon who i was talking about a few years ago , who had some <unk> twins , to separate them , in part to make a name .
and i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political asylum in consideration instead of one operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offering an incredible opportunity to allow people to allow people to be able to allow them to change the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like or looked at , if we could have more involved .
and i want to say something to a feminist is radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are made by the different kinds of anatomy , <unk> if people will apply a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i was interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average , -- not any , but on average -- tend to complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable , very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , i asked myself one of my favorites , who my interest in feminism was a feminist , a feminist question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about the stereotypes about gender dissolve , so in feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , and i thought , well , i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is to say that there might be something , on average , which makes us different from male brains that makes us different for <unk> social relationships and sound for the <unk> .
and maybe it &apos;s what we need to go to the future when we have to go to democracy -- less about the individual bodies , what matters more about relationships and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a difference as a people we can make , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to take a different kind of opportunity to find a different kind of <unk> , crazy outfit , to photograph , and to email , too .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of influence on the environment , and also my wallet .
i meet all sorts of amazing people ; my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s doing my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i did for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone get with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
i brought seven pair of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week of what i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i made bet that i &apos;d like to bet everything i might want to carry on , if i had to go to palm water .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around at ted in your underwear -- that is , i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i &apos;m going to do , whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> of <unk> .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the <unk> tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
and this whole outfit , including the coat has got me 55 cost , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing in this whole week .
monday : it &apos;s a bit powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be <unk> , bad <unk> if you wear <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : so <unk> is being totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be able to try and adapt me .
just be who they are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , they &apos;re not going to be aware of it .
wednesday : give you your inner child .
sometimes people tell me what i would look like , as if i &apos;m going to watch it <unk> , or i remember her seven-year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not going into something good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that it &apos;s inside and the outside is a wonderful person , then there &apos;s nothing they can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit for everything .
and finally , saturday is a unique one , unique to personal style is a great way to tell the world something about one of the world without saying to a word .
it was always been proven to me and again , when this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to happen in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;m going to donate it all back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn from this week is that it &apos;s okay to let me go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things not to be emotionally <unk> , because the way to corner the corner will always be a different <unk> , <unk> <unk> outfit , which is just waiting for me to love a little bit of my heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something here to show you .
think about this as flying as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
some time ago , it was so that if you wanted to win a formula a race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver , and a good car .
and if the car and the driver , then they won the race .
this would be , in <unk> , call a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start to appear in our lives .
our cities have been in the last few years , in the past few years and electronics .
they become the computer in free .
and as a computer in free , they start to respond to other ways , and they &apos;re driven .
if we <unk> cities , that actually is a big deal .
by the way , i just want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the land that emissions up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense of view of the everyday life is <unk> .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli , for moma later on , during the summer , organized <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , begin to speak to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there is to both a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction that we humans have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
now , our environment , for the very first time , to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that sense .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is of one of the first things that i want to introduce you to .
it came from four and a half years ago .
the summer was a happy -- 2006 .
it was winning the <unk> .
some of you will remember it , it was as a italy to france , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
won &apos;t anyway , in italy .
now look at what happened in this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see , in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
this morning , before play .
you see up the timeline .
once afternoon , people here and they &apos;re making calls made and move .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call to go .
second <unk> . the end of normal play .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , at that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big big deal .
the next day , everybody went into the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of space <unk> , where , since the rome time , people go to celebration -- to have a big party , and you can see that matters at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city of today , in a way , as we can &apos;t .
another example , a different example of feeling : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well , today , we know all about where our things are coming .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know little bit about where the things are going .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to pursue the garbage while he goes through the system .
so we started with a bunch of volunteers that we &apos;ve got , a little bit more than a year in seattle , helped to tag the things that they &apos;re going to see -- different kinds of things , as you can throw out -- different kinds of things you might throw away with .
and then we have the little chips that little brands , on the garbage tie , and start tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away , is not just going to go away somewhere else on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we were to show that human beings , then we can push change behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> was a beautiful tradition in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were involved in a <unk> <unk> was , imagine this tubes , and the valves , <unk> , valves , they open up and close .
they &apos;re doing something like a <unk> with <unk> water .
if you fall down that <unk> , you can write yourself patterns , images , pictures , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to it , and you can open it up to this picture , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it has a very dear it .
and we got the mission to design the entrance to the entrance .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it gets open , it &apos;s going to open and it &apos;s inside .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to reduce those syringes , you can even lower the roof .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just like that the architecture is almost disappearing .
here you see how the building works .
you can see the person who &apos;s going on what happens inside .
and here you see me when i try to test the sensors that open the water , to open up to become getting wet .
now , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped .
but actually it was more fun at that night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that open up would open to you , but it &apos;s a building that still breaks down and holes in the water , you had to jump down now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we do .
but reality is unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water , and the projection .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine if these <unk> could really start flying .
imagine if you could have small helicopter that flies through the air , and each of them with a little bit of <unk> light with a little bit of <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter in front of you as the ones you saw earlier that you saw earlier .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in formation of two dimensions .
or <unk> , but in three dimensions , which changes what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of <unk> .
you can play with different ways .
imagine a screen could appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud from <unk> that you can come up with , and you can go through that , you can look at them from lots and lots of directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to form a <unk> v .
so if you zoom on on the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is being <unk> .
it could be every single impulse that has a momentum that comes from people &apos;s movements or so on .
so i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the power <unk> in milan -- we took its movements in 3d as an impulse to the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s also a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can understand the entire movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all the <unk> , you can play and gravity can play with color and gravity and <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a direct impulse to the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re doing for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to take the people to do something and to change the environment -- almost like what we call it , <unk> <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine if everybody can give a donation to a <unk> donation .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened last decades is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow it can go to the challenges of asking us -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually have the people working together in which they collectively do things together .
the cloud is a cloud of <unk> , in the same way that a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s an intensely physical thing in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom of 2012 , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more , and it &apos;s as kind of connection to community .
so the things that the physical cloud in the sky is and something that you can go , like london , <unk> new <unk> .
you can go inside .
and one kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i was very important .
through my work i &apos;m trying to express that people are separated from nature , and everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was nearly 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i did awe .
my heart sped off , i was <unk> , while i was trying to believe what was in front of me .
the <unk> around me <unk> nearly 60 meters from the water , and i was just amazed that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , a year .
<unk> are born as a calf or a calf from <unk> .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with a clear way of interacting with their surroundings .
some of them refuse to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while other people don &apos;t stand and make more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg iceberg , you think that you are isolated , separate and alone , just as we see humans often .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg melt , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
and during the iceberg , he <unk> drinking drinking water , which feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go back to my photographs of this <unk> , as if i was portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious mind that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and never again exist .
it &apos;s not a death of death if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i <unk> is very young -- several thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the final images i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i have in greenland in greenland .
very rarely you will actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
so here it is .
on the left-hand side , you see a small boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and it &apos;s just like the iceberg of a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely blessed by work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing that i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing on him .
i have a company that makes design and animation , and so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and admire it .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;m just going to talk to tony .
i just want to leave him with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t it -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher and a remarkable insurance , you can actually do that .
people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how does it communicate because now ? &quot;
does anybody have seen the film &apos; film and &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- their fingers walking along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can this be ? &quot;
so i got a check , just a check out a check , and instead i made a check , i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was supposed to be .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying that all the time is not able to communicate it . &quot;
so i talked to a couple of months later on a conference .
i met these people of <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface , and then to draw on a <unk> surface that would only recognize the negative surface .
so they move around and do <unk> like this .
they say that all the things up there are going to be shown up there .
it starts with the genital organs , the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally , people actually do art .
but there &apos;s always a life cycle in your presentation .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first of all , we have the insurance insurance company , and actually , for <unk> , we have a device that he can communicate with -- an stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s a really funny thing -- i call it <unk> , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from the world -- literally , from all of the world &apos;s corners -- to us home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers have taken over and <unk> and <unk> our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that , and we were <unk> , and all the images on the walls were <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;re programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , and we have <unk> , they set up a <unk> , and now we have a device that is freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can download the code for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free by limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital too .
everybody paralyzed , actually , can communicate with its eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s a room of somebody else and this room .
there &apos;s all of these <unk> <unk> .
and after a year of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony for the first time , after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it &apos;s beyond his life support system .
we tend to <unk> his bed to the outside .
we set up a projection against a wall of the <unk> the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
so we also had to <unk> in the parking lot , and we had to deal with ourselves as a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he sent us an email with the following : &quot; for the first time seven years , i &apos;ve done something .
i feel like i was getting underwater , and i finally got someone down to the bottom and raised my head up to my head so that i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
it keeps us on the shelf and we keep going .
and we need to improve on that machine .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
and somebody who has potential to make a more powerful potential .
so we &apos;re in the process of finding out how to do better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one made of it .
it &apos;s all from our pockets .
so the pile was , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us , and then december , has we honored the <unk> , as one of the 50 <unk> inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april , when this april <unk> <unk> in the city of los angeles <unk> to the city of the city of los angeles .
and there &apos;s probably pretty much the toughest <unk> of the <unk> show -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these boys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , what i &apos;m thinking about is , if you see something that is impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , that the microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all right here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , had never been able to do anything with <unk> , but i &apos;ve just got a little bit of <unk> and amazing people with amazing people so that we could put something together on the legs .
and then this question should be each of you , and every single day where you have something that needs to be done , it &apos;s going to have to be done . if not now , when ? and if not myself , then ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m writing for children , and most of america &apos;s most likely to be <unk> .
and i always tell people that i &apos;m not like a scientist to come up with .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is for common something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you go to block and take it as revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle at the time was in high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was <unk> in the <unk> green and blue beaten up until a teacher was saved my life .
she saved my life by putting me the toilet in the bathroom .
did they <unk> .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had an thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from that teacher , <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the man who i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should say , i should say that i have <unk> , and i want you to have 14 . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , and we took them , and we took us to take them , and we gave it to her family because it needed to be necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just when the woman who wanted me to know me as adults , they turned to a box of <unk> , and was placed in my hands .
what was happening was that the circle closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is , the death of a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this today was a lot mentioned here .
he needs the same -- it would take , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you &apos;re up to 1,000 meters .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine the engine industry , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds fear <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> .
so i saw them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan could .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
turn on it down .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i was able to see it in your eyes , and i was horror that was at end .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment it &apos;s all different .
while i later thought about it , i noticed one , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because when the wine wine , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to move more <unk> .
and this urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we got the george washington bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , &quot; i thought , &quot; there &apos;s one thing that i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i <unk> to become better in everything that i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i gave it to my ego .
and i <unk> the time that i &apos;m wasting for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to people .
and afterwards , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i haven &apos;t got a lot more to my wife with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be , right ? i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; <unk> , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , dying is not terrifying .
almost like , we &apos;re going to prepare for our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really <unk> in an idea , which is that i just wishes one thing .
i just wish i could have my kids growing up .
for about a month after a month , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not much more powerful talent ...
don &apos;t yet .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
i realized at the time when i was connected to each other that it &apos;s about to be a great father .
everything else , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father .
i became the miracle of <unk> that day not to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , coming back and alive .
my call to all the people today , is : imagine , the same thing on your flight -- please not -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would they do to cut them down , because they think they would be there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for nuclear weapons are <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here are <unk> .
now , if we can do systems , the systems of <unk> and the valves control , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it that is an effective <unk> device on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> building , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the driver planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> goes to the gray box , damage to the <unk> and iranian <unk> <unk> -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you about how we found that .
when we started to <unk> our research back six months ago , it was completely unknown to what the purpose of this <unk> was .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated what the <unk> part , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
and it seemed to be a little <unk> , with these gray boxes .
and the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we &apos;re infected our environment and studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> things like a <unk> <unk> that our cheese didn &apos;t like -- but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made a sense of my eyes .
and after we experimented with different kinds of cheese cheese , i went to see that this is an <unk> attack .
all along a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active in the gray box around the gray box , when a special program was discovered , even if this special program was discovered , it &apos;s trying to get it on this goal .
and if not , then <unk> does nothing .
so , i really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , a $ <unk> power plant , or an <unk> in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we have the <unk> code and found that he &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were designed very professional , of people who had obviously all <unk> information .
they knew all of bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
in fact , you know the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking here from -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you about how we were capable of becoming smart .
so , after what we were looking at , <unk> were <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking at <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring these real world into connection -- potential in the real world .
so we needed some theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or prove it to .
so , to make these theories , let &apos;s talk to us that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because there are most infections have been reported .
now , in this area there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically the <unk> nuclear power industry and the <unk> nuclear power in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant to my assistant , &quot; bring a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and they know what to do , to compare their expertise to what we have in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor there is this moving part in the <unk> , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , then you &apos;re actually able to break the <unk> , and then even get the <unk> to explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was slowly , and very easily -- apparently in trying to make <unk> despair so so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to come quickly from them .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a look at a glimpse from what we were looking at very precisely and <unk> .
so , for example , the number one <unk> <unk> comes out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started with science literature <unk> , about how these <unk> were built in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re <unk> in the so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> .
so that &apos;s what makes sense .
and it was even better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 or 15 .
and guess what ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , this fit perfectly well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we &apos;re looking at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results have been done by several weeks by a couple of weeks .
and often we just ran out into a <unk> and <unk> us .
anyway , we found that both digital of warheads are actually on one and the same goal <unk> , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slowed down and slowed them down and <unk> the big <unk> with six <unk> of interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big and whole , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals were going to be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool here that we &apos;ve discovered -- got me <unk> out of the socks .
the gray box is the gray box , and it &apos;s on top of it .
now what this thing is , is that it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- so , for example , <unk> and <unk> code -- and it &apos;s <unk> code that &apos;s still available during the attack , who &apos;s left with <unk> data .
and in fact , this false explosion is taken from <unk> before .
so , it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> is fed up with <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> in the <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more potent .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> , where a human <unk> cannot respond fast enough .
so , in a power station , for example , if the great <unk> is going to be fast , you have to <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re at risk , you can do some bad things .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> is going to notice .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would be so good working -- in a power plant or a power plant .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- the <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to have the <unk> stick on the stick stick , how we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to disseminate .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the greatest issue of goals is not in the middle east .
they are in the united states in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we have to make the consequences and we start preparing for better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported much of the fact that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the driving force is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the superpower superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you so much for letting us have a <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years trying to place me in situations that are normally very difficult and at the same time .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i &apos;ve been working on a <unk> -- dangerous .
i was filmed with <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days that i spent nothing to eat here , getting fun at the beginning , a little bit of difficult in the middle , very dangerous .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to come here in a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would be a little bit different .
some of you may have heard about a couple of weeks ago i put an ad on ebay .
i sent out a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> my tedtalk in 2011 .
but , apart , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
so if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some pretty awful situations in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could prepare for me , nothing could help me to go to something so difficult and as dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is make a film around <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so what &apos;s going on in the &apos; 50s , <unk> <unk> , is that everything , from up down to the bottom , from the beginning , from the beginning to the end of the end , is to say this is the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be with the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to note .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to be brand x , but we &apos;re going to be safe to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the film .
so maybe we &apos;re going to sell a shoe , and it &apos;s the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn in ...
the greatest <unk> car that you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , you have a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , apart from one of the reasons , that brands are part of life , actually , to get the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of this film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love to be able to make sure that if <unk> would help us do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; look , because that &apos;s a negative <unk> -- but you know how this will evolve ?
how much money will it require to do that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it anyway , some really <unk> brands .
now , who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer ?
and the answer is absolutely most likely .
but is it a difficult thing to film about film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... meaning , not so optimistic .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about which brands .
yeah .
if you look at people that they have to do it with .
there are some places we can apply .
let &apos;s put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; let &apos;s see the camera from &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out it was really , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and so just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
none of the wanted to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , to give you so many people as possible as possible .
in particular , in the world today , in this context of new and old media and the <unk> media -- isn &apos;t it the idea to be in this new exciting new exciting media that the mass does this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes .
it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , what is this picture .
you see , if you &apos;re interested in transparency about the <unk> , this is one of the first images that appears that .
i really like your , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; immediately , <unk> , characterized by <unk> and access to information , particularly what <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we hear a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president , says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to the fact that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented .
but why ? now transparency is fear -- like this weird bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like that strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else ?
a whole dish really <unk> food .
that &apos;s a very risky thing .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father , when he was standing , and he &apos;s sitting with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , three versions , there are three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who do big , giant , giant <unk> , and i have friends that make little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , say that the reason their movies are so successful at the <unk> is that they have .
and then my friends who are doing little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we have to compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see ban in the movie ?
always if i &apos;m going to go to the journey , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i get somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you want to interview a little bit before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; or a &quot; <unk> fusion system , &quot; they will have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well for women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can answer all your questions and give them an <unk> frames .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re brand a brand talk .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , you know -- you know , remember people on ban -- that &apos;s kind of what we &apos;re interested in .
in the words of the words of the words .
ban is <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way that you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes into positive , unlike &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we get them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh air .
these kinds of things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to say nice clothes .
<unk> <unk> hits , except at the <unk> .
all right , what is the brand business ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably the <unk> glamour .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff .
but normally , i have a <unk> , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> <unk> .
so , the brand two : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : part of the <unk> , part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> around the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand , <unk> industry .
<unk> 4 : your brand is fedex because i was <unk> .
brand five : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what was noticed is that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could actually help me understand what was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for that , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like this with their thoughts and feelings about them themselves .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and so on .
all these things come and start from a place , and i came up with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you is to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is this to the mind and feelings about them themselves ?
it &apos;s like i wish to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are bizarre . i like curious things .
tell me about why &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what is the <unk> ? what <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you who aren &apos;t .
what else did they go through ?
do you have to be afraid , in which kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what makes it come .
there were quite a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her <unk> had two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
they make a very good mess .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction in it .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both .
what other brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii , a little mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if any of you would ask you to describe their <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? are you going to get blood in <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
is it something that a little quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh as the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , failed and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate what ?
are it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
over the course of the movie we had more than 500 companies that were up and <unk> and <unk> the &quot; no , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control of this movie because they didn &apos;t have control of the last product .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using nowadays to use the <unk> of the brain , and to make films as well .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> were banned .
in the entire city for five years , for five years have no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school in school , where companies are in <unk> schools , in <unk> schools .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got of the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what those brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies might not really have their interest in the meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists directly to negotiate with .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people get to think that our world challenges .
and what was this for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
now , since the film was the film on the <unk> film festival , we can look at this .
it was the <unk> in january , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million <unk> of this movie .
this is actually just a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film is not leaving yet .
you don &apos;t even have this online . no <unk> .
he hasn &apos;t come out of other countries .
well , finally , the movie has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project that almost every single game that we were talking about , which is to make their customers recommended .
something that i think that i think is that if you take your chance to arrest your chance of taking risks in that risks .
i think when you keep people from it , you get closer to the failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid your employees , you know , you &apos;ve got to get a profit .
i have to feel that we need to take people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that you might have .
finally , in progress , we should embrace the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage in the cage .
do you welcome the fear . don &apos;t welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a big taste full of it , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they were taught in transparency , &quot; from my good friends of ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations all over the world .
<unk> presents : &quot; they welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , morgan , in the name of this : what &apos;s happening right now with the <unk> ?
this is a great question .
i have a check that gave me a check on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> -- a check on $ <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so , 18 months ago , i made something else in google , and i <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is also , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums , from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and access to her degree .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education of a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i didn &apos;t have too many museums and i had no access to that art .
so when i went to visit this museums , i started to learn a lot to learn .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- to make art more accessible -- with technology to bring together .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around in the museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , that van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re walking around and <unk> .
you want to get in the museum ?
you open the map , you jump with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to be in <unk> .
just further . a lot of fun .
look around them .
thank you , but the best comes .
so , i &apos;m in front of you , i met from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us the picture , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i click that off .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been recording with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get to 10 billion people ? &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you .
you can make it very easily and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around and realized that there is something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the end , and i noticed that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , with some famous with a few known when i met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where a <unk> hits a stick with a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you a overview of what i &apos;m going to do , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but in a second .
let &apos;s jump back to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding the details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s first , if you want to see van gogh this masterpiece , because of the creation ?
you go inside . you can actually go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorite images , i &apos;m going to zoom in in the cracks .
this is <unk> , never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but there &apos;s no time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- whether you have rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum online -- you can make your own collection on your own .
simple , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all over the way , and you can send your friends on what you feel like when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing that all the wonderful things here is not from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to live with this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s called properly online .
now , the biggest question that i &apos;m asked is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to add up the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be divided into two houses .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the the logical hand side , and then half the right one that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for instance , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain at this scale ?
some of us may have decided to be one of these extremes , but i think that , for most of the people in the audience , it looks something like this -- with a high school teacher , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be intuitive and intuitively .
and so i look at one of the people , in common with most of the experimental <unk> <unk> , which needs a good share of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition about the experiments in fact .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look at how it responds . and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they have evolved over the years is probably that one thing can be only at the time of a place .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they didn &apos;t born with this idea , they evolved it .
i remember looking at a child playing on a <unk> .
he was a <unk> , not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i &apos;ll bet it &apos;s a very good lesson with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is the great thing that is not just letting you leave , and that you &apos;re going to stay in one place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they are not <unk> .
it would be an awful model for a <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you &apos;re playing with your particles , you can find all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics , a few years ago ; you had to describe quantum mechanics little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great mundane objects around us .
this didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t enjoy the particle .
well , i play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean no one has ever seen a particle .
but i didn &apos;t like it very much .
because if all things are made out of particles , and all those particles have the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just should just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this should be not like that .
so i would be better to feel better with all of the things that if we could somehow show that <unk> the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i was doing a couple of years ago exactly what to do .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was <unk> in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
here i &apos;m up here . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it is like a certificate , and it &apos;s on the edge of the edge .
so i did this thing in similar ways that you can chip a computer .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of a <unk> pool of hole and the thing .
this thing has this thing that has the ability to be in the <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird stuff but then i &apos;m going to stop doing all these things , because i don &apos;t want it to bother , or frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are equally feeling .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s over to you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece metal <unk> , we had to <unk> all the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the light off , put it into a vacuum , and we put it down all the air and <unk> it to almost close to right now , to the elevator , was the piece of metal free , to behave like that .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really moving into it .
and instead , it &apos;s just because it &apos;s just there , <unk> it , the way it was , the way it was like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vibrate at the same time and vibrate -- something just in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what i truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and no way to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think atoms about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms of the atoms of those metal are still moving , and the same atoms move up and down the same atoms .
just towards precise <unk> voices , it &apos;s <unk> .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom in the same time is two different places , which is the same piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth it for all this year in the clean space space , because , you know , you know , the <unk> between a single atom and that piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the little atom and the metal .
so if a single atom can be two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine that you would be at the same time of several places , how would you feel that ?
how would you make a sense of your body in the room ?
there is another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that looks like this as all the objects in the elevator really are only <unk> objects that are in a small room together .
and you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not right .
there &apos;s more to it , even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should have decided we should be thinking about economic development .
it should be our goal , if families think about this , where they want to live and work on , to give them the possibility of a hand , between at least a hand , to choose new inhabitants .
we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city available to you to welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s worth so much more important than it costs them .
so , we could just make the world very simple with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities were <unk> .
now , it may seem absurd to you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just trade up the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they did it .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you would be going to do in these homes , and in these homes , and its environment will avoid the law to avoid signs and <unk> .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to hit all of these <unk> .
but you could go to a whole new place , a completely new building block , assumed the laws would support one such building and don &apos;t be <unk> .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments can create new areas of enough space , and have given you a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that , you know , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform of reform .
in 2009 , <unk> was under a major <unk> area .
the next <unk> elections , won <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program has both innovations and <unk> .
he asked <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i &apos;m preparing to speak at tedglobal .
through improvement , once and through the study of consumers , i tried to do this complicated concept of using the <unk> city to reduce the world .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that , you can &apos;t be <unk> existing <unk> .
we pay for new technologies , but for the progress of progress , it needs technologies and laws . and it &apos;s usually laws that help us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to a tedtalk .
so , again , he showed him .
they were calling me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s go to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotel in miami in miami .
i tried to make sure that they are valuable to how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , and remember that a surface in some cases , in some cases , is worth thousands in some cases of dollars .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion at a time when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> , who said that we need to do this project that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s important to do .
i was asked to get a lecture on the fourth and the fourth january of the fourth and fifth january a lecture .
so i have one another with some facts <unk> talk , which has one chart like this , which has been trying to illustrate , that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of denver , and the picture is the new airport that was built in denver .
alone this airport is 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite got <unk> .
the audience faces were very serious and careful .
the head of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line , which has come to new opportunities for people .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new possibilities for leaders .
we &apos;re in an area of danger .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand square miles .
and shortly afterwards , on january 19th , you voted with congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control system that has been <unk> for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a low crisis , it was taken in congress for these <unk> <unk> with <unk> a voice .
all parties , all the parties of the society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , it was <unk> to a voice <unk> voice to a voice .
immediately , after this election , between the 21st and fascinated , february of the <unk> february , the delegation of the world , traveled from about 30 places of the world that were most interested in the business of <unk> .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big new urban city , which is built in south korea <unk> big as the city downtown .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after four years , after four years , having got to get up .
the other place that was really interested in urbanism was singapore .
there were two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so , if you think of it as practically , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; you &apos;ve already consider this land for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system , that <unk> is allowed to participate in an external system .
a country has already offered his supreme court site as a court called the <unk> appeal of the system for <unk> the system .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring in funding with one .
one thing you already know is , you know , there &apos;s a lot of west .
there are many businesses who would love to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would love to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who say that they want to live in permanent areas .
a million people leave every year , and go up to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced by their families to <unk> their families sometimes to be a single mothers who have enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s kids , they &apos;re trying to find their parents to find out their parents for a decade .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about building a completely new city ?
or in fact , <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of them around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from <unk> have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions they do on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently made a survey of 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , the average american , a typical american , is 70 .
in addition , recently a study was done by ceos where they saw a week of ceos .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes that documented this ceo , and how much time they were making decisions that were related to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo &apos;s busy ceo <unk> problems .
every one of these topics , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of your decisions were within about nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of your decisions required you an hour or more of your time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you are in the nine minutes of category one hour ?
how good , do you think they &apos;re making decisions in it ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest <unk> of our modern time , which is <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hands , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question of today is , are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> convenience ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 species of mustard and <unk> and <unk> and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we were still <unk> .
i loved walking in this business ; but at one point i was asking myself , well , how do you never do something about it ?
here &apos;s the olive <unk> .
they had about 75 different olive oil , including those who were locked into boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to the leader of a day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model that you have all these possibilities really , really ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that would come every day , and usually they had the cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we set up a little bit right the entrance to the entrance .
we have six different tastes that we put in <unk> , or 24 different tastes put together , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would be more people who are going to stay and try <unk> ?
there were more people standing there , if there were 24 , about 60 percent when it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw ourselves in the case of what the people were going to buy .
now we saw the exact same effect .
from the people who were on the side of 24 , only three percent of the people were actually a glass of <unk> .
the people who were left when they were six , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do the math , people bought six times more of a glass of <unk> who they had six to the choice of the choice .
now , to decide not to make a glass of <unk> , it &apos;s probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that it &apos;s also affecting us very badly .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to tell you a study that i &apos;m talking about with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we &apos;re making the decisions for almost a million of a million americans in the entire united states of the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that was possible to be able to be able to do a <unk> plan , the <unk> plan , the probability of being saved .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that would offered people anything between two to 59 together to a <unk> .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered that , in fact , that , in fact , the participation was less .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that are offered two teams , had a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that nearly 60 fund offered , the <unk> now dropped to roughly the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you have to participate in <unk> , if you were to participate , it has negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate in it , rather than the more opportunities they were available , the more empowered you were to choose to choose and vote it .
the more opportunities they were available for their entire money , the more they put their entire money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , is to make the decisions that someone would recommend if their future financial services matter is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we have seen three essential negative consequences that provide the order of more and more choice .
they push the decision -- push them , even if it &apos;s against their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that they do less happy , even if they make objective objective .
the main reason that we &apos;re looking at it is that we may enjoy enjoy these giant shelves full of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t actually compare the comparison and make something out of the amazing offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways -- they can just apply to their business .
first of all : limited .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true of true as today , that less .
the people are always concerned about what i &apos;m saying .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble <unk> , the different head and <unk> types of 26 items , you &apos;ve got to have a increase in sales .
when the golden <unk> corporation corporation , she sold 10 to the worst sold <unk> <unk> , experienced that the profit from <unk> and reducing costs .
you know , the average ted metaphor offers today , 45,000 two products .
they have a typical walmart offering them today .
but the <unk> supermarket , who today &apos;s <unk> supermarket is <unk> , and they only offer 2,000 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
every single harvard person takes automatically in a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice , they &apos;re not going to be a fund , they &apos;re not <unk> .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it down .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
and if your employees cannot be <unk> , they can &apos;t do it either . &quot;
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he &apos;d be willing to offer all of the people in this audience to the most beautiful road on the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read them that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i urge you to clap , if you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
is that all that ?
well , let me show you a little bit more .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that it &apos;s an objective of looking at the first time when the first time had more information , when the second time , but i would guess it was a way to guess it in the second time .
because the images made it real for them .
which brings me to the second technique that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding that people in order to understand the difference between the possibilities of understanding what the consequences are associated with the individual options , and that might be vivid and specific .
why do people spend on average about 15 to 30 percent more , if they use a credit card or a credit card , as in cash ?
because we don &apos;t really feel that way .
and it turns out that if you make it concrete , it feels a very good tool for saving people &apos;s way to save more .
and while that meeting , we &apos;ve got these gathering just as close as they &apos;ve always been , just as we used to .
the little one that we &apos;ve got to use was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if they would save money .
third technique : <unk> .
we can handle more categories than to deal with more choices .
here &apos;s the example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> supermarkets , and down the <unk> in the northeast field , varies the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines up to the <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
because the categories told me how i can make them apart .
here &apos;s two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called <unk> .
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the ad is on the right jazz , then you clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that those on the left hand side jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a profoundly <unk> <unk> .
the categories has to say to the <unk> thing , which is not the choice .
and that &apos;s a lot of time when you look at the long lists of all these courses .
who do they actually want to inform ?
my fourth technique : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we can just simplify them .
we need to slow the complexity slowly .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated choice : buy a car .
here is a german <unk> , which gives you the opportunity to give your car a whole self .
you have to make 62 different decisions in your car .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that you provide a choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 opportunities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half of the customer is coming from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients goes from the small opportunities , four gear , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how are they interested .
if you use the <unk> in the decision to make sure that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find out is that the people who go from the very few <unk> are always going to go and vote again .
we lose them .
go from the very little choice to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is that the order of that information is this information .
when i start with the simple start , i study like i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the gear is choosing , i don &apos;t want to say nothing about my preferences when i &apos;m going to pick it up .
it <unk> me as well as a product of the great product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m ready to get me to get interested in this .
let me sum up .
i told them about four techniques that &apos;s called the problem of <unk> -- limited -- they &apos;re going to do the <unk> alternatives ; they &apos;re making it real , <unk> -- we can prepare for more categories , less opportunities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you manage the opportunities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you service .
because i think the key to the best choice is to pick up a choice .
and the more we &apos;re anonymous at select , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . a japanese look at me .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then then why that &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- <unk> , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that &apos;s infinitely difficult .
but <unk> have enabled that , we all share that , or all our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , there &apos;s more than 48 hours a minute .
and again , it &apos;s going to be a tiny percentage of times , and it &apos;s going to be thousands and hundreds of times thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> this video that he had filmed his house in a <unk> national park .
in 2010 , 23 million had been looked at .
this graph shows how it looked , when the video was popular last summer for the first time .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing when you put high mountain mountain <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was already in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
and then jimmy came .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that ended up so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> us to imagine new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
rebecca <unk> : &quot; <unk> &quot; of the year .
it was going to look at this year nearly 200 million times .
this is what the graphics look like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems to be something of nothing .
what is that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , friday friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , many blogs began to write about it .
michael j. j. was by the <unk> science theater , who was a very first joke on twitter about twitter .
what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> would take a point of view with a big audience and accelerated process with that process .
and then this community was formed of people who shared this big <unk> , and they started talking about it and playing with it .
now , there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on youtube .
already , in the first seven days , there was a <unk> for every single <unk> .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was going to look at almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats looking at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there was <unk> .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground that was made by a stupid joke to something we all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something that we do .
who could have been <unk> ?
who would have predicted who would have predicted black or rebecca black ?
what kind of <unk> did you do when that sort of thing ?
in a world that each minute two days will be uploaded , it can only be a unique and unexpected kind and unexpected <unk> like this .
i &apos;m not very interested , i was not really interested in doing this great video when a friend said , i should look at this wonderful video , about a guy who <unk> in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i don &apos;t have a ticket , but often there are disabilities who don &apos;t let you go to the <unk> .
and this is a very surprising and <unk> , casey &apos;s funny idea , and his case was looked at for five million times .
this is a way for everything we &apos;re doing creative .
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , which is that everybody has access to the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin beaver -- justin beaver -- did the beginning of youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas of light .
and today , we all feel like the owners of our popular culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not hitting the media today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle which is still combined .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole lives of the simple hope and freedom of being together .
if you &apos;ve got to <unk> him in front of the <unk> of <unk> in front of you , he had to admit that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now .
he moved back to the silence .
he died , broken by history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories are .
my grandmother never forgot his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job , to learn that the story has really been trying to help us , and we &apos;ve been through it .
the next thing that shows you , as a boat in the early <unk> silent , is lake <unk> .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her life , she gave a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that she could fail .
after a four year-olds , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat still on the sea , as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
they were the greatest fear of pirates , rape and death .
as most adults , my mother wore a little mother <unk> on the boat .
in a <unk> , i would have had my sister and my grandmother , and my grandmother to drink .
my first memories are by the boat -- there &apos;s <unk> of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the bug , the <unk> and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came up with the pirates , but from the <unk> of men on our boat , or the <unk> of the motor that six hours didn &apos;t want .
no apple had no apple tasted like this .
after three months in the refugee , we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who build a new life together .
we were going to put us in <unk> down , one of the <unk> most of the <unk> <unk> , the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence told me that was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the odor smells came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> was between people who had shared exchange for people who had in common .
my mom worked on farms , then on a <unk> assembly line , six days , double <unk> .
they kind of have to have the time to find their english and <unk> .
we were poor .
each dollar has been given , and has got into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it . mostly , the new stuff that came out of the second hand .
two couple <unk> for school , each and every one of those holes in the other .
<unk> <unk> to the <unk> because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
home where ?
something <unk> inside me .
there was a meeting at reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get you out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister , and i slept in bed .
my mom was exhausted , but we were told each night , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job to remain awake every night until their <unk> came to the end of the day .
she opened a <unk> , then she made a <unk> and she &apos;s a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> change , angry and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and <unk> were searching .
centers were set up .
i lived in <unk> .
in one way , i was the classic asian student student <unk> demands himself .
in the other part , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , wearing <unk> and <unk> .
but so many received help over the years .
and because of this aid , i was chosen in my last year of <unk> as a young weapon of the year .
and i was <unk> to the next <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> from <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who had never heard of , and in homes , their existence had never been invited to .
i didn &apos;t trust the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she reminded me that i was so old as the age of when we climbed the boat .
no , no way .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , they lived on the borders of the possible .
and even though i had conclusion , i realized i could not expect me to come up with a career in law .
there must be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easily collapse to the collapse of the horizons , it can mean that easy to be accepted .
so i went to see enough out of my house , and i went to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as much as you do it .
possibilities that are not allowed to be explicitly .
there was a energy , there &apos;s an optimism optimism , a strange amount of humility and <unk> .
so i was following my gut .
and i &apos;d collected a little team of people who are <unk> , and they were a <unk> challenge .
for a year , we had no cents .
at the end of one board , i cook a giant soup soup that we shared with us .
we were working late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a couple of brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i made the decision to draw into the u.s .
it &apos;s just a journey there .
my gut reaction again .
and three months later , i moved and the adventure left .
before i talk to you , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died short after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman , whose mother she beat her .
in her husband , she was worried about a <unk> , by the time you got him in trial and <unk> in your own case , and a greater <unk> than she won .
&quot; not said , &quot; come <unk> .
i was in sydney just in a hotel in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and they were sitting in a buddhist temple .
we told her stories and <unk> her that we were still with .
and by midnight , the monk and he said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
and she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she says you &apos;ve been , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t <unk> them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s a band of women .
see , who we were , who we were , and how life has shaped us , now we can now see that the men who might have been in our lives to have been in the <unk> .
that defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous , every wave of <unk> , the <unk> of the motor , the long horizon , nothing willing to guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to this , and i could make it safe .
and also , <unk> is a mother , today &apos;s fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it ever photography ?
because this is a picture of , of course , with his camera .
but i still began photography when i was my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i put together it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was using the process of planning .
and when you take a picture of a camera ends with a camera , if you put it on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about photography , at the right place to be at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s beginning to the process when the trigger will be pushed .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> street .
but it did an unexpected twist .
and still a realistic level .
or pictures like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like it could have been , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think about a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s about to capture an idea , as really a moment .
what is the trick that it makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the lights ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
the end of the day , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made in a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly sophisticated objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , in a particular way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if there might be .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we cheat our brains because our brains are not quite sure that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in bringing pictures .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so things that make a realistic picture look , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things we don &apos;t think about around us in our lives .
but if we can take photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a viable outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not a very special images .
and , you can do something special , like this .
so the first rule is put together the same perspective .
second of all , put put together put put together .
and these two images are <unk> these two demands -- at the same height , and the same <unk> .
third is about being able to make it impossible , where the individual images begin to end up with it .
it &apos;s impossible to tell you how the photo actually was put together .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think it &apos;s a landscape of a landscape , and the bottom one was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of all of them .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place to create a place as a place to find a place because you don &apos;t have to compromise compromise with your mind .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to find them to find the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> .
the bank comes from one other place .
the <unk> is from a quarry quarry .
and yes , i even got the home on the map of red <unk> to look at it .
so to get a realistic result , it &apos;s about to get out of me .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and this is about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very well planned .
and then if you do good images , it can be quite beautiful , and it &apos;s also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that happens is that we are our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> was , you know , it &apos;s <unk> .
and they &apos;re not particularly scientific , and it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , who are the patient , family , relative .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we want to think that this is one of the main problems that everybody -- perhaps most of the electronic electronic failures , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> , a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on it .
and every morning i do that .
and yeah , i have a job as you may recognize .
i have my job with 95 pounds of <unk> .
it works very simple : every time i jump to the scale , you send my data on google health data .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to get from my <unk> <unk> , so you can see where my <unk> is because it &apos;s not just in the moment where i &apos;m going to take care of support , not just in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe that &apos;s what i &apos;ve known to you about 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my <unk> , and people talk to me before in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a smaller lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients because it could be used against obesity , or it could have patients smoking patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to get into some kind of game games to get their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be on an iphone or so forth .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to their own child , and to share with other people , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
take a time to use that easily , and start embracing patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but by <unk> .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
all right , we know exactly where all machines are around <unk> .
we know another one where all the stations are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient help ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> was to find out .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> <unk> .
we set up a website and we set up a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed .
and over 10,000 , we were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for that .
and we designed a <unk> system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and <unk> , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can save the next few of the life that can save life .
and so today , we don &apos;t want to only do this as a <unk> , like the product called itself , but also to introduce it to a <unk> .
and we want to bring this into a global level .
and we ask for our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us to behave like <unk> <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re on holiday and you &apos;re on vacation , you can find your own blood pressure or someone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask for is that companies are all around the world teaching us to <unk> these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please help us in and try to improve your health , not just to make you better , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and i want to force my little <unk> , that we force ourselves to conservation .
... it <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh , a moment .
it may take you , until it &apos;s loaded .
now -- we can skip that way -- i &apos;m just going to skip a bit more .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over there ?
okay . thank you .
the code is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we &apos;ll let them work with <unk> .
instead of send them in the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what they can do with technology .
so you meet al .
al is a <unk> in boston .
how did he get to look at this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston on the &quot; code for america &quot; program .
they were there in february , and it has last february of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never <unk> this fire hydrant .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , was to notice something else , and that was the residents that were <unk> <unk> , directly from those parts .
so he did what any good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you <unk> to <unk> it when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very humble app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any <unk> .
it spreads very rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city of <unk> , who has seen this app , not for the snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to test them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to use the app to clean up the citizens .
and chicago , they just introduced them to the <unk> of <unk> when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use that app .
and she spreads it so , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t really work that way .
the actual <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston for three people , and for three people .
it was about a way to find out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we were told later that when it would go over the regular channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have been two million dollars .
and this is still nothing .
there &apos;s a project on the california justice system that the taxpayer cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that is written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread from <unk> , and then a kind of shot off the institution of the institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private enterprise , how many people think she should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that you represent a new generation that &apos;s <unk> the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re doing very well in the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who are making the tools that we need to be effective together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all across the country who are getting up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
today , a lot of people have given government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of about it because things change .
politics don &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government will give us their power from us -- <unk> you : &quot; we are the people ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government , when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it was the government to choose the public &apos;s office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in local community planning .
this is the call for service and information .
that &apos;s where you come out , normally , if you <unk> in your town .
scott , i get scott <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and see if the cattle are <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
and boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write the app .
this is work very smart people in the office of new urban <unk> , in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in this : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happened with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talked to human .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next entry we got , &quot; i went over there , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , honey <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of a platform .
i &apos;m rather talking about a platform for people to help and help others to help others .
one of the citizens helped a other citizens , but the government played a central role here .
it connected these two people .
and you could have to connect them with government services , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and flexible alternative service .
if a neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is vote .
this is because government like the government is on the top , and politics are the top <unk> .
and what is below that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own this thing that we own , and we &apos;re paying for it to be something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to be done for us , we have to do a bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> occurs .
we &apos;ve got to be on the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned that has written a very detailed <unk> report that &apos;s a very detailed answer to the <unk> of <unk> .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to ask yourself .
do we really believe that we achieve what we need to do without improving an institution to make all that action of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology can make it possible , the function of the government is fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by providing society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the right systems .
now the average age of fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with their vote for granted .
they don &apos;t fight that battle that we all fight ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can feel your mind on every single channel , and you can do it .
so , if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications to work that improves the government .
and these apps , let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a trash <unk> flip .
and sure enough , we would have these fire fire all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who receive taxes , they &apos;re paying and pay attention .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the incentives .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a little bit , boring slide .
... could you just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;d chosen from my studio .
it &apos;s not about the details of slide , but it &apos;s actually about the absolute form .
and this slide shows a analysis of an analysis to us about the performance of <unk> structures compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like others , that we find a lot of things in our field , a way of just a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step is equal to a power in the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we have to use this type of scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
a little bit clearer , because i &apos;m just going to draw something out of paper here .
now , why do we draw , in the technology of <unk> curves ?
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to take a different technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then it would be on the <unk> scale , and it &apos;s a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , that &apos;s what happens .
so if the <unk> campaign would be as fast as the <unk> progression , then we could get <unk> in a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
that was never going to be in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which increases all the few years .
now the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t see them going on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that all over the course of the time and forever evolving as fast as well .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like this , up to something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s what it is about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think i &apos;m going to think something like this .
it &apos;s really , it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often want to ask myself , is like this new world will ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a kid in 2000 , and people often spoke about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go on .
so in other words , the future is declining since i &apos;ve been in the world for a year .
i think the reason for that is that there &apos;s something in the going to be there .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that at the moment , it doesn &apos;t make any sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future because everything will be so different from what we &apos;re doing now , that a simple thing that we don &apos;t make sense of .
now , i want to talk about what could be this , this transition where we &apos;re currently in .
so to make this happen , i &apos;m going to start talking about some other things that have really nothing to do with technology .
because i believe in order to really understand this , we have to step back and look at the thing in a longer way .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the <unk> of life .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of the <unk> chemicals .
now , when you &apos;re looking at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how you do it .
some of the oil spills contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow them .
they were all that way , started to <unk> .
these small oil oil spills were the <unk> <unk> .
however , these oil spills were not about alive , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they have <unk> chemicals into disparate quantities .
so each one was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> , which had been <unk> <unk> <unk> faster than any other and integrated more chemicals , and shared more chemicals .
so these <unk> <unk> to survive longer and they <unk> in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if you did a trick on an abstraction about abstraction .
in any kind of a way , which we don &apos;t quite understand , these <unk> have learned the ability to get information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for cell as being information , and in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , you have in this <unk> , evolutionary kind of way of found a way to them , which allowed them to be saved , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is to store this kind of information over the time of 2.5 billion years into it , which is the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is the recipe for us , is the exact same code .
every being used to use the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can , only for <unk> , ourselves in this code .
and i have a <unk> here of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the distance from <unk> <unk> .
in it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code consists of normal letters that we use to make the <unk> -- and i have written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve got it <unk> .
so if someone would like a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus , and it &apos;s <unk> .
so what is the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which were started to communicate these cells and share these information , so that communities of cells evolved .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
that &apos;s the reason for that , for antibiotics , grows .
now , some bacteria figured out how they can stay away from penicillin in the dna , and now we &apos;ve got a lot of bacteria in the dna , and we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
that communication allowed us to now have the reasons of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat .
so they either have survived together , or they went down , and that meant that if a community was successful , all of the individuals have been successful , all the individuals over the course of the community remain <unk> and <unk> .
now the <unk> is there , where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to make the recipe for the whole community into dna .
and the next interesting thing took about another billion years ago .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of a lot of <unk> that act together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked themselves anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evolve , so that the level where evolution was happening , no longer the single cell , it was the single cell , but the whole <unk> that we call organism .
the next step is actually within these communities .
the <unk> began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything different than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the neurons that are built up these <unk> .
they started to train the specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding , understanding information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- that &apos;s what happened in the time of a single organism &apos;s lifespan of a single organism , instead of over these evolutionary periods .
so one organism was able to learn , for example , learning a certain fruit of fruit , because she didn &apos;t taste it and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could be done in a single organism lifespan by hundreds of thousands of years , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years needed , because this information had to be learned from the individuals who had died because of these fruit plants still weren &apos;t there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> using this particular <unk> process , because evolution could be used in a individual .
she was able to take place in a time market .
what happened after that , the individual organisms were to communicate a way to communicate .
once , as an example , the <unk> <unk> is known as a human version of human language .
but it &apos;s quite amazing invention if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and there &apos;s basically <unk> <unk> sounds like this , in the hope <unk> idea in your head , which is a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we take a little bit of a very complicated , turn it into sound in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve started to abstract , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that we have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods -- the abstraction of our methods , let &apos;s present .
the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on , all of our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and can be able to continue faster than we &apos;ve been far beyond .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you also saw <unk> little <unk> where he &apos;s shown a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right before your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> once again .
the first steps of history that i &apos;ve told you is a billion years of a piece of play .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to have a few decades .
so the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for that -- if something <unk> its <unk> .
the more changes it , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feeds on itself .
i live for a living by building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently , but the recently has been done in computation .
my current activity is to design objects with such a great complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any transistor transistor is power in <unk> .
it has billions of them .
and it makes it partly with the methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in recently , is the evolution itself .
that &apos;s where we install a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
in order to call , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that made from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> please a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now , please take all the judgments of these random chosen instructions , take all the programs out , and pick up those programs in the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort of numbers , which would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for that .
so , find some things that are most likely to include numbers .
now , of course , the chance of random instructions is the instructions that you can just sort of numbers out of coincidence , so i don &apos;t probably think the instructions .
but one of them may be with a little bit of luck in the right numbers .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences of the sequences that my <unk> are on the next .
you store those , <unk> the rest .
now , <unk> all the <unk> that have <unk> the numbers .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction .
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the characteristics of the two programs .
so , i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to the mapping than others .
say , &quot; please this process again . &quot;
<unk> it again .
maybe there &apos;s some mutations .
and try this whole new generation .
all of these generations are very few milliseconds .
and so , i can take a evolution over millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or more complicated cases , or more complicated cases .
and finally , i get programs the numbers of perfect ones .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than each program i could have had to write by hand .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
they are obscure and weird programs .
but they do do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you get the job done , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on the fact that she did the job .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , and he &apos;s a map of <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &quot; this plane is made of <unk> <unk> , which works together to make your flight safe . &apos; don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not equal to if it &apos;s too complicated .
so let &apos;s start to rely on computers , for a process , which is very different from the classical engineering process .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity of complexity as it would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunities yet .
so <unk> <unk> is technology .
so we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer a lot faster , so we can do it even faster to do this processes faster .
so it &apos;s going to happen .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today from themselves today .
we raise off .
we have come to a point where analog is at the time , the analog to the <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite see what the hell we &apos;re creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after we got something else .
i find it very <unk> of us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what comes next .
now , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m thinking here now , before i &apos;m going to get <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan about two years ago .
i was in the sky with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it not changed since the ancient indian era , &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
if we were to travel at the indians at that time , we were around to the sky and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
back then , when the great indian <unk> thirst had <unk> thirst , he took an arc , shot into the soil and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were being replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to <unk> the sunset without a camera , and without my tweet .
i thought technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me a little silver <unk> .
this piece of 50 years became the most powerful thing for me .
she became an <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and <unk> to my imagination .
i got it like this , when we got to send our fancy clocks and cameras out of it .
they kept on being inspired by that .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic , rather than kill .
i started to illustrate books at 16 .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to connect to storytelling to storytelling around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s getting images and text , and animation , touch and touch .
the storytelling has more and more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to print a interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s the box : &quot; that &apos;s a box i write .
and i made a character in the book .
and back down , again , a letter for me falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really enthusiastic about this opportunities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean the wizard and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies found fireflies in a jar and always exciting .
this is what you have to blow up the ipad , and it &apos;s fireflies .
and this is reflected away by the rest of the book .
a different idea that fascinated me as a child is that there can be a whole galaxy in a single <unk> .
and therefore , there &apos;s every book , and every world , a little <unk> that i put in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always been static , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and it stands for guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows in other places of the book .
i &apos;ll go in here .
but also , for me , it &apos;s important to create something that <unk> is also very important .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india have heard of india , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> was caught thousands of years in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history of history .
it &apos;s a story that has evolved to cope with new affairs of affairs .
on the issue of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without <unk> .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book you &apos;re sent to a quest . you have to go out and get off with the camera of the latest images natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> . you &apos;ve got to go out and tag a picture of a flower and tag it .
in another chapter one , you have to <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;
this creates a kind of a social collection around a digital collection of photos you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of trying to connect the world and connect the world .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction at which you use the video of the resolution , and through <unk> reality , an animation of <unk> looks like it &apos;s <unk> on a plant .
at one point , the screen starts filling up on the screen .
you have to do the sound of the <unk> , you can fly and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology are getting closer and closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we closer to the natural world and the magic , and the love of our childhood lives through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or prisons .
i spend most of my time with the most socially <unk> and in places where there is a lot of despair .
here at ted , to be able to see and hearing , how stimulating that is , i gave a very much force .
at the short time here , i became an obvious thing : ted has an identity .
you can see things that have the world in the world .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it makes sense and strength who wouldn &apos;t have it .
i say that because identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher who are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn a lawyer in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who became dominated by a <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , powerful woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the starting point of many disputes in our family .
she was a <unk> daughter .
their parents were born in virginia as a slaves born .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed very strongly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was loving too .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
and she pushed me so that i could barely breathe . then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; i said , &quot; well , if i said &quot; yes , &quot; she left me .
it was something that was going to be that you always wanted to be near .
the only problem with this was that you had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to acquire attention .
my cousins is everywhere .
i remember , i have to have to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into the living room and all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and it went to me 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up and she came to me over . she took me on my hand and said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you know , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you get to promise you don &apos;t do it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat me down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , you &apos;re going to love your mommy . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise with promise you &apos;re always going to deal with you . &quot;
i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next thing to me is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it falls to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;d promise to me is that you will never be drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old age , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and one year older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just as much as it else .
and then he took a drink of beer and he offered my sister , and she took her , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . you &apos;re fine . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this , you know , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had what you had , you know , your sister had something . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you . do you do . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still going to do you mad about the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that you &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i should probably not do that .
this will be in public here .
i &apos;m a <unk> years old , and i <unk> that i never drink one drop in alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i believe it is <unk> . i say it &apos;s identity .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people that they don &apos;t believe the first thing .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren , you know ?
my grandfather was during the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> disease .
and she believed that this is the issues that we have to take care of .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in jail .
today , 2.3 million are .
the united states today has the highest <unk> in the world .
seven million people are released on the top or with <unk> <unk> .
i think our world has fundamentally changed our world .
in socially weak and black share of despair , despair and hopelessness , because of change .
one of three male <unk> is in prison between 18 and 30 , in prison , in prison , or in prison , in <unk> or <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , of philadelphia , london to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men in prison , in prison , or with <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just shaped , but it &apos;s not just shaped by questions that have been <unk> with poverty .
we have an arm in this country that she &apos;s treating a lot better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as guilty and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affects the outcome .
however , we seem to be content with it .
a politics from fear and anger have convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> developments .
now , my home state of alabama is permanently <unk> when they &apos;re prosecuted .
and here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male deaths are held their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the <unk> of civic civic <unk> is going to be as high as the <unk> of the civic <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that <unk> children to death in prison .
in this our country in the country for children &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of technology .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe , because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is that the real question is : has a human being to die for one of him dying ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we see identity .
the other view is not : anybody has earned death for a crime , but did we deserve to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve been executed , comes to one that we have for innocent loved ones , the <unk> and out of death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent innocent innocent people .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly anyone with an airplane , if for nine airplanes , the fly will go .
but somehow , we can do it by this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students the story of my students . i &apos;m talking about slavery in this talk .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the second world war , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear <unk> .
or from bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
they say , &quot; no , tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> , and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and therefore , we don &apos;t really understand what the importance of our actions in historical context .
we are constantly flowing .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s very hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the <unk> is not to truth without the willingness to and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , they had these willingness to , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept talking about germany in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly troubling to hear you speak . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , they can never give them more in germany .
it was quite silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to kill us for the systematic treatment of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
it would feel like it was going to feel like living in a world where german state people were allowed to <unk> , especially if there were plenty of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , there &apos;s the mental illness there .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not concerned with these tough issues , those are the positive and the wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to a complex world .
for me , it means making the time , thinking about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> that will never be at ted .
but think of a way in which our own lives are integrated .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we rational , so we certainly do .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s these <unk> , which i believe that they &apos;re driving , not just to be open for all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the great <unk> politician , once said ,
as we were fighting in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most is , but what we needed most hope was to be in eastern areas , to be witness to be witness . &quot;
now that mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that i have to do with that , too .
there &apos;s no gap around technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears in poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she will touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege of meeting pink .
so these women were met and they were just <unk> .
and down to the city called me <unk> , and then said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks , come into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , what will you do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just stop .
it was always inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day , i sat there and i heard these women , and after a few hours turned to a woman for me , i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say <unk> , say , &quot; well , say , &quot; well , tell me the same thing . &quot;
what do they try to do ?
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
people want to help people who were convicted of innocent people .
we want to fight bias and discrimination .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without a new <unk> device for children .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death death .
we want to eliminate <unk> .
i gave talk to my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then <unk> <unk> to me , and i put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways of making those challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity is dependent on our humanity .
in my work , i learned quite simple things .
i learned some simple things .
that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes a little bit of it , he &apos;s not just a <unk> .
even who someone kills , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because it &apos;s like that , there is a basic human being that needs to keep the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
finally , a society &apos;s not going to be measured by how they get their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the convicted <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing that balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m getting tired , as we all .
sometimes these ideas ahead ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very harsh websites .
i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> and visit a clients who likes to be 13 or 14 years old and to visit a adult court .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
how does a judge can turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed up too long , and i thought , goodness , if a judge can transform us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you also should have a wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think about it , i started working on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black customers like a privileged , white , white <unk> . <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; to treat <unk> .
i explained , i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and the police and the <unk> .
there was a crazy line that there was no longer <unk> in this country that there &apos;s just <unk> .
in the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i was only dreaming of it , whether i &apos;ve even dreamed this crazy player or actually .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to court .
a few months , and i &apos;d just forgotten about everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court , and that &apos;s the crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed with overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so painful , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and the staircase to the court .
when i put the staircase on the dish , there was an older man , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me over and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and <unk> me .
then he did the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went into the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> <unk> , have you put this crazy <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and we started to discuss .
more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we were talking about color , about poverty , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors who went down and walking .
he used to see the window through the window and could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and down .
finally , this older guy came up with a very common black man who sat down , and sat down behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during the break , a <unk> came in , which was that the janitors was in <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the elderly .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
i came to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more <unk> , but that it &apos;s the justice system .
that we &apos;re not fully developed as human beings , unless we &apos;re interested in human rights and <unk> .
that our survival is going to survive with the survival of each individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and creation , with entertainment and creativity and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell you about that , which is just to say , just to say , lose the point of eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen that in this audience , this community is an obvious thing to help and tell you something .
what else can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a spring in this spring , where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to do a effort , something that goes to the politics of <unk> .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;ll be a billion dollars a billion dollars for death .
and yet 46 percent of all <unk> ends not with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all <unk> come from trial .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
so this <unk> is suggesting that money in more <unk> and safety .
i think there is opportunities .
over the past three decades , the <unk> in america is <unk> .
the fact is , often , in a context of a relationship with the increased <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
now , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find it in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> crusade for drugs .
so the dramatic number of numbers come in the prison .
we have <unk> ourselves from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now , we have <unk> , <unk> , who bring people to always get behind bars , for a <unk> , for the theft of theft , rather than that you force them , the things the sacrifices gave back .
i think we need to do more , helping people to help people who are victims , not less .
and i believe that our current <unk> don &apos;t help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a string of the <unk> .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
so , bin laden is a increased increase in <unk> .
<unk> : famine in somalia . <unk> : <unk> the police .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : dangerous <unk> .
6 : social decline . last speaker : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . <unk> nine .
different speakers : <unk> . tornado . tornado .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six years -- but it would be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media will prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are giving exactly these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second one day , every minute , our senses are much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we can &apos;t be more important than our survival is the first station for all the information that the amygdala , the amygdala .
the amygdala is our early warning systems , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> all the information on the edge of all of the information in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to think about negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand , &quot; is a lot of true .
now , with all our digital devices , that &apos;s seven days a week , 24 hours a day all of this negative news is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is going to be worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the huge progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is that we &apos;ve done a series of forces over the last century , so that it &apos;s possible to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water <unk> , water and energy -- we have already .
and as humans , we are much better at solving problems in a very long way , but then finally , to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , that <unk> <unk> the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has to be a tenth of reduce .
and that comes out of the fact that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs have reduced <unk> .
now , steve pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is the last 130 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we &apos;re in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
remember , a great percentage of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , water , tv , television , mobile phones , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have to dream like this .
the basis of a lot of them form technologies , and they grow up .
so my good friend , ray kurzweil , has shown that every tool that is going to be a big <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of moore &apos;s law .
that &apos;s about the cell phone in your pocket , about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and depression .
this is the result of a faster computers building <unk> computers .
they slowed down neither of our big problems .
also , despite the logarithmic , on the left-hand side , it &apos;s up on the left .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer in watson ?
that was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for newspapers and for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the <unk> of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence owner was given to every single owner of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m at ted here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all over these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services in a decade positive the lives of a decade of people .
think about the fact that a group of students can influence life today from billions of people .
30 years ago that would have seemed ridiculous .
today , we can refer to dozens of companies that are being able to do this .
if i think about abundance , i mean , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to make a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating advanced goods abundance .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited dinner with the king of <unk> .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
but the king of <unk> got <unk> .
aluminum <unk> was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made from aluminum .
although aluminum <unk> percent of <unk> takes place , it doesn &apos;t come from pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
so let &apos;s put up this analogy for the future .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet who &apos;s filled with more energy than we use in a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is to stand .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , for the first time , it &apos;s been able to reduce cost solar energy solar power in india -- <unk> rupees in 17 percent .
the cost of solar energy dropped last year by 50 percent .
the last month , this is published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , six cents per <unk> , versus 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , then we will have water in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember when carl sagan was the <unk> 1990 when it was on saturn , back towards earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that is covered to 70 percent .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent water saline , two percent is <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting 0.5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
it can generate a thousand liters per day from different sources per day from different sources of water -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , polluted water , polluted water for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been <unk> to start a big <unk> in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola globally will apply that technology globally in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we also saw this in mobile .
you my goodness , we get to soon the 70 percent of mobile phones across the developing world from 2013 to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a cell phone <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> than president reagan .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communications in the abundance , no one ever would have predicted .
and it &apos;s still getting better , the things that you and i spend several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and a picture , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are now going to be <unk> and cheaper to <unk> in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is possibly what &apos;s expected us in health care .
i had the pleasure of the last month , with the <unk> of what &apos;s called the &quot; $ 10 million <unk> prize . &quot;
we request teams around the world , all these technologies together in a mobile phone in a mobile phone , that you can talk with the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it or test his <unk> .
and to win , this device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device , in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the health of health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> sequence , which is not known for the heart , it calls it to the heart of the heart and prevents a pandemic before you outbreak .
but now the biggest force that makes us a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the largest population against a population is a better education and food in the world .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve had two billion people connected online in 2010 .
by 2020 , we go <unk> from two billion <unk> .
three billion new minds that we have never heard of before , we will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic growth , i see one of the greatest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars to the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be able to use a healthier healthier , and they &apos;re getting trained through the <unk> , and by using it to be the opportunity to use 3d printers and &quot; <unk> computing , &quot; and so much more more productive than ever .
so what can you do about three billion , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> .
how would it be with a set of new , never <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to make change and make change , for the first time ?
what will be the three billion people ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that small teams who are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things to create , can create the big business and governments in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know already .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this is a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university and etc .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who have played online online games .
and it turns out that nowadays , human pattern scans better <unk> the proteins than the best supercomputer .
ladies and gentlemen , what tremendous trust me in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals , to make us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion other minds that we can work online to do online to master the new challenges , and to do what it needs to do .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical response , and i am .
and maybe i have long enough in business as i can allow me to give up a piece of my own false <unk> to give me this .
but before i come to my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are near the world <unk> and moving us out of the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is filled with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turns out to be statistics and to make it a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to give you a number of statistics that i hope you &apos;ve heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat ends .
that means that the player is clearly three from 10 beats .
this is the ball of <unk> , and he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not going to be able to throw the ball out of the first base , didn &apos;t get it in time , and the rule was in security .
three out of 10 .
do you know how you call a <unk> <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody from the rest of the four .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> , the last <unk> season , met 400 times over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , in which i feel like a lot more , or maybe a little less comfortable with that .
suppose you &apos;ve got a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> , which is <unk> 400 on <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine you &apos;re in a remote remote region , and you have a beloved person with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> in <unk> with 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the <unk> <unk> .
and she &apos;s a <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows in all medicine what a good surgeon or a doctor should be or <unk> .
however , what we &apos;re doing is we included every one of them , including to be perfect with the claim .
never do a mistake , no one makes the details of thought to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i put in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> <unk> student .
in high school , brian <unk> said that brian <unk> <unk> would learn to be a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> in the nurses at the toronto general hospital in the nurses here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> each branch , every branch of the <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> .
and all of the time , i was more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew everything and everything , or at least as much as possible , or at least as much as possible , at least as much as possible , that i &apos;m immune to be <unk> .
and it worked for a while for a while , until i met .
i &apos;m going to show you a <unk> here in toronto as a woman to me as a woman in the hospital .
at that point , i was struggling with the <unk> layer of service .
and it was my commission when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for <unk> .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i listen to her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i heard her chest <unk> , i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering from <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of all of the blood pumps , is to get a part of the blood in the lung , and filling it slowly , so the <unk> came out .
and that was not a very difficult diagnosis .
and i put it on the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a period of a year and a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistakes ; i sent them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take you up and i did what i have to have , which would have been a call on my <unk> , so it would have been a chance to have a picture .
and he knew them , he would have been able to be able to <unk> information .
maybe i did it with good reasons .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take its responsibility that i was like , and so i would be able to be able to address my patients without it .
my second mistake was worse .
so i put it home , i &apos;m going to give you a little voice , i was trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
so , in fact , it &apos;s been so striking to me that i asked the nurse , which is , &quot; well , do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and they brought them home .
and i went back to work out .
the rest of the day , i had this evening of feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , <unk> the hospital , and went to parking lot with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home to my way back home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen a printer , but another three words , and i &apos;m afraid of the three words that i know .
the other medical fear is also fear , but the <unk> is very , very well , because we &apos;re only seeing the patient &apos;s so volatile .
the three words , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient , you know ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s gone , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back to die .
now , about an hour after that , you &apos;ve got to get home , after i sent them home , and the family was called 911 , and the family came up with a blood pressure with a blood pressure from 50 , that &apos;s dangerous .
they &apos;re barely breathing and was blue .
the <unk> broke all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was shocked by the interior .
and i went through this rollercoaster because she came to the intensive care system , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized she would never <unk> .
she didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , it was <unk> .
the <unk> day , she <unk> them -- woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you &apos;re saying that you don &apos;t forget the name of those <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
if you do <unk> , you never do it again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is that i &apos;m going to do a <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s the one who says that it &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re bad at it .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t based on my <unk> , he was very keen .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the <unk> <unk> and sure that i wasn &apos;t going to be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why don &apos;t i have asked the <unk> ? why did i get home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i in medicine ?
but slowly , it took place .
i started to feel better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i said maybe i can feel better .
and i was <unk> that if i took my effort to perfection and never doubled again a mistake that could be <unk> the voice .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> but the top <unk> and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately , he wasn &apos;t dying .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back to the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , made me feel free , and went back to work to work back until it happened again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve lost two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a couple of things that you think about , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital , that &apos;s just 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there &apos;s probably no <unk> in their treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the kidney x-ray of the kidneys , when that was without <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient , and called the <unk> in the lower right sector .
the other had diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> in order to <unk> him and asked my colleagues as well .
and he did , and he did it in the lower corner of the in the lower sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was fine .
both cases of <unk> , <unk> me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim , but a total nonsense is .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i was the silent voice that tells me that what could i do with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my fault , so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like right now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about .
when did you last when you heard about the last time of somebody talking about <unk> <unk> ?
oh yes , you &apos;re going to hear a cocktail party and you like to hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody else &apos;s own mistakes .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a <unk> in my hospital would have lost the wrong leg , then trust me , i would have a chance to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
it &apos;s completely denial from mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who are <unk> , and those who <unk> with good outcomes , and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response , like antibodies who attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones that make mistakes from medicine , we have a safety system .
but there are two problems .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day , in which one of the 10 people are either wrong or wrong , in which one of the <unk> is going to be a false or wrong more and more and more devastation .
in this state , about 24,000 <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
in the united states at the end of medicine , the institute of 100,000 .
both of them are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t think so much as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in which medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a chest pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give it a easy breath , and then suddenly , the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same trajectory .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always the same thing .
and my patients are not cars ; they report their symptoms not always in the same way .
all of this is <unk> failure .
so if you take the system so , as i taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s not the end of it .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and then your <unk> , you &apos;ve come to see your head , then you see it down and swallow , and start to tell their stories .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment that puts them in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new formal doctor is a human being , knowing his humanity , accepted her , is not proud of making mistakes from them , so that it can be passed on .
she shares their experiences with others .
it supports them when others talk to their mistakes .
and she shows others whose mistakes are , not to be <unk> , but in love with a loving , supportive way of all .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes people that people fill the system with life and when it &apos;s like that , then people make mistakes from time .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m a <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn to get it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live .
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about the time to use it .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was here .
you may think he &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as very common .
it was a <unk> .
in the &apos; 80s , in a great style , it was fish in a big style .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
this story has heard many times from the galapagos or from the other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> describe it as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , <unk> <unk> , illustrate .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t have it from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was <unk> and some <unk> <unk> .
there were <unk> of about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were living good at ghana average about average .
when i returned , i was getting back to the fish half of its size .
they measure five inches in adults .
they were genetically modified .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells story about my <unk> in southeast asia in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , <unk> europe is a lot of <unk> .
<unk> used countries , which had already started 100 fish , the industrial fishing fishing ship rather ugly ship .
and i was driving on it , and we made all the southern <unk> ocean , particularly in the southern hemisphere .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now i know it was the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the bottom of the sea was the deck and then became back .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you &apos;ll have an elevation by and then begins with the used commercial fishing .
the reason is change . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be <unk> .
this is a dead <unk> .
they were not eaten , you threw it away because they were dead .
so we started a alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> will grow from fishermen every single time , when they &apos;re in areas that have never been fish .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
we fit our <unk> on the new level , and we don &apos;t talk about what was there .
when you get it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green part of the country , the green one .
over time , it &apos;s changing , because it &apos;s changing because people are completely natural .
every generation looks at the images of your conscious life at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and <unk> .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and in the end , they just want the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal now .
we want to get things that are gone missing , or things that are not as gone as they were .
now , you could think that the problem was for people to be sure when they were living in <unk> societies , and they were killing a few generations of what they had done .
because obviously an animal that was very often there , that there was a lot of times when it was <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a common animal .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why not perceived as loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the large animals , and the large fish .
they &apos;re less likely to get them .
there &apos;s a little fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientist , confirm it really differently .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you like in a previous form of references , aren &apos;t the way you would like to make the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a <unk> project , who observed in this area of great <unk> , can &apos;t be used , or <unk> , doesn &apos;t usually be <unk> because he &apos;s not using science .
so , we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in sophisticated societies because they don &apos;t trust the world of the past .
this is the enormously important role that has a marine <unk> play .
because through marine biodiversity , we &apos;re basically putting back the past .
we can make the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the <unk> changes , and very low .
so , the people who see a marine <unk> can see the <unk> , and that &apos;s how to benefit from looking at their <unk> .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they have no access to -- the people in the midwest ?
here , i think the art and the movie may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched -- apart from the <unk> , why were it so touches from the <unk> ?
because there &apos;s something <unk> that we &apos;ve lost in a sense .
so my suggestion , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you is cameron , so it &apos;s &quot; avatar ii ii &quot; is spinning underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , you had to , if you had a typewriter , you had to focus on a typewriter in the <unk> .
they also had to know a leaf with <unk> from these typewriter .
the reason for that : the government could track government , where a text came from .
found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these ideas .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how it would affect freedom of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and there seems to be <unk> .
and that was an example , in which our own governments have the technology against us , the citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three things that are existing in the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge lot of money .
there are many known cases of <unk> , <unk> that made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from estonia .
that &apos;s alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss bank account accounts for mr. sam <unk> here , and on this name , <unk> million dollars here , and on this name , were <unk> million dollars as it was frozen .
mr. <unk> itself is in free feet , which is unknown .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to be worse .
the future will be most crime online .
the second one we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for money , <unk> like anonymous who do it , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
that &apos;s where we are , before <unk> .
it shows a performance , what happens when governments have their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody has been hacked , and had been hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior citizens the question , if he had it for possible , because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die of one such remote remote ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate , you need to have a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> services , for example , for example , <unk> .
but , you know , if you &apos;re in the foreign .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of <unk> .
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , in egypt , the <unk> in april , 2011 , the <unk> of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in that records , a folder was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , the notes were in germany , in the <unk> government , who was the egyptian government for a few programs , with which they were -- in very big frame -- all communication of egyptian citizens could capture .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments provide western governments with <unk> governments for their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago we had something called <unk> <unk> , which was used by german <unk> <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a <unk> <unk> , then it will be <unk> with pretty much safety phone .
but we are now far beyond that .
they tap their connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> , their <unk> .
so , if we think about these things , the obvious idea of the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t seem to me because i &apos;m an <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while we today , in 2011 , our governments like to trust our governments is , every right we &apos;re getting out of it forever .
and we trust , we are blind to one every future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : modules , from cement , have measurements that fit together .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into the situation , building things that were bigger than us , building , a stone after another .
essentially , the <unk> was the building of our time .
six years later , in 1947 , of lego , lego came out .
it &apos;s called the automatically <unk> stone .
and within a few years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion rocks have been produced -- or 75 stone points for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to be beautiful , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego it made possible for everyone .
lego has basically the <unk> , the building in the world , and it &apos;s a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , the next year at bell labs , the next revolution , the next one .
the transistor was a little <unk> that was <unk> us from a world of static <unk> building blocks of a world in which everything was interactive .
like the transistor <unk> , the transistor allows us to build more complex colonies , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts reserved for the experts on our time .
i was at the media lab at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea of how engineers do the power of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , clay motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is input , pink and orange , wires .
so , all you have to do is to connect a green and a green one , and they can build very quickly .
you put a green one green , and you can make light .
you can fit a switch in between , and so you have a little <unk> .
so , take the switch out to be a <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> , and they made a little <unk> .
and put it in a second effect for you , and you &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , you need to program <unk> or <unk> gestures , allowing you to program <unk> gestures .
so , to slow it down is <unk> or slowing down , just just on this button and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea of <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want every single interaction on the world in a <unk> stone .
lights , notes , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> to kids and see them play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start the electronics that surrounds them in the everyday school and they &apos;re not learning in school .
like , like , the doors of the <unk> work , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod is to touch .
we &apos;ve got <unk> too <unk> .
so , for example , we had no idea designers with no experience of electronic things , which began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and they gave them some designers that have no technical experience -- just box wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the fear of darkness .
for those <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics , just another material .
and we want to make this material all available .
so <unk> open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> download , download them .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because the world we live in , this interactive physical world , belongs to us .
so , go ahead and start invent .
thank you .
