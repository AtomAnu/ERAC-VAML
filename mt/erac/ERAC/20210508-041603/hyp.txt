and of course , we share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to divide with the <unk> <unk> through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and making art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique <unk> <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
so , all of these people teach us that there are other people in other ways that there are other dimensions for guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , you only get one with hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world are a web of <unk> and <unk> life that the earth <unk> and for that earth is as important as the biological culture that you know as a biosphere .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species .
and just like the biosphere gets strong , this was done with the <unk> -- just with more speed .
and the critical thing about this is the extinction of talked .
when everyone was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet earth .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is found access to the physical world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , an ecosystem , spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages today , today , as we sit here in monterey , just half of no longer are in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to be taught anymore . that means if nothing is going to be done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be lonely is being silent , one of the last of your people who are talking to your language , not to have a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors to pass or to expect the wisdom ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually someone anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly person dies and take the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you would realize , like , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you through a journey through the <unk> journey , a quick journey through the <unk> , to try to try to understand it , which is actually lost .
now there are some of us who are in some sense that i &apos;m saying , if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
for example , take this kid in the northwest of the amazon forest in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not benign between the colors and the green blue , because the <unk> forest is affecting the forest that people are dependent on .
you have a curious language , and a <unk> language called <unk> <unk> : you have to marry someone who is a different language .
and all of these are the <unk> in the past , and the weird thing to be , in these big houses , in which due to six or seven languages , is that you never ever heard somebody who &apos;s learning a language .
they only listen to and start talking .
or one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first one in 1958 , the first one in 1958 .
in 1957 , five of the other <unk> tried to absorb five <unk> of <unk> .
they include <unk> photos of the air that we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen a difference in their lives in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that the <unk> of the devil .
but the <unk> weren &apos;t killing <unk> with the spear .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through <unk> .
but at the same time , she had a clear knowledge of forests , which was amazing .
their residents could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps , and determine what animal animals could smell of it .
so to give you a sense of <unk> , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in the <unk> and <unk> is not a cult of black magic .
in fact , it &apos;s a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of worldview of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
so if i asked you to counted the large world world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , <unk> , or <unk> , whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith , of course , there &apos;s been a <unk> of this very deep religious idea , which is the tragic part of the <unk> in the <unk> .
but what makes the interesting difference is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
they give birth to the spirits number .
the spirits <unk> can be <unk> from the large water , respond to rhythm to the rhythm of living , so that the <unk> <unk> for a small <unk> moment for god .
<unk> say the <unk> , &quot; your white goes into church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take that spirit , how can you damage to you ?
so you see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body that it &apos;s <unk> when it comes to a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the kogi of the sierra nevada <unk> de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> civilization , which is the heart institute of the columbia dead , and in fact , in the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the people in the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered <unk> .
so to the present day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , which is education , but education is very extraordinary .
and over the course of the time , they will be culturally in the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- balance .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they &apos;re the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , the destruction of the world &apos;s <unk> .
now this level of intuition is really important .
so , <unk> are neither <unk> , and they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
now , what does that mean ?
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of an <unk> or a bunch of <unk> .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which is the metaphor between the individual and nature of nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a picture i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon northwest .
this is <unk> , from many of you , the most powerful <unk> compound from the repertoire of the <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
and if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , that substance that it contains this kind of substance that it contains as well .
this powder is about something like this <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be <unk> the reality of the reality , but the resolution of reality .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t take <unk> , because they &apos;re by one in the human gut enzyme enzyme .
you can only get into some other chemicals with some other chemicals that mao mao &apos;s <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> from the way that are necessary that are necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself .
so , how can these people come from a <unk> crowd of 80,000 plants that are <unk> plants that are <unk> these two <unk> plants , which is that it &apos;s combined to create a kind of <unk> version , so that all the bigger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this fabulous tyrant , trying and mistake , which is meaningless .
but you say , you say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
these stem cells , the <unk> , 17 variations on <unk> that you see all the time in the forest that we see , as a form of a form .
and then you ask them how they answered their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understood something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out , you know , you get 17 varieties of <unk> and you &apos;re singing to one in a different <unk> .
well , that &apos;s not bringing you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
well , the <unk> problem is that even those of us who have the very difficult state of native native to the very hard state of native to the <unk> , they look at the past , as a real world , as the real world , is accelerating our world .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t hear less on sioux than they are , and arrow , than americans stopped when americans stopped being americans when they were and <unk> tasks .
it &apos;s not change and technology will threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power .
or if we go into the hills of tibet , where i do a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of humans is widely convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of people , is not not convicted but in general , as part of a <unk> behavior .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering from that , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at <unk> stage .
the father of this young <unk> was the followers of the <unk> lama .
this meant that he was killed by the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle bug with his holiness in the diaspora to <unk> people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned , as punishment for -- to be wealthy to the crime .
he was in the age of two years of prison in the prison to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live it without it .
the sister that was doing this brave <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
one day she went to a <unk> <unk> , and she had to <unk> them for seven years .
the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people &apos;s minds are something <unk> .
and at the end , we really stand in front of a choice . would we like in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s very humbling to think that our species might exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , which brought us into agriculture , and at this moment in the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> <unk> and hierarchy , specialization , created -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern world , as we know it is barely 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we &apos;re facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we &apos;re going to be human by the human being , you &apos;ll respond to the importance of being human .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the eastern government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of our regime , they were forced to move in settlements .
the man of this old man refused refused .
the family , the fear of his life , had taken all the tools and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit people have not fear the cold , they use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> were originally made from fish that were wrapped in <unk> .
the man of man &apos;s man didn &apos;t really fear at the arctic night or the flying storm .
he <unk> out , he made his pants out of <unk> and <unk> into his hand . and when the feces started freezing , he formed them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the side of the <unk> , and he was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took the skeleton of the dog , <unk> a sled , <unk> another <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> on the ground .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the inuit , and all the native americans in the world .
the canadian government , the canadian government , in april 1999 was the complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new homeland and <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , a state that can look for their people and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who went to the distant goal of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent components of the human imagination in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , how the dreams of our own children are in the hopes of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we think that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
156 countries sending our <unk> .
our magazines are being read by millions .
thank you .
we see a lot of , many <unk> of digital photos here , which you seamlessly have , and that &apos;s continuously <unk> , over the course of the way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many people are looking at how big these collections are , or how big the pictures are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can affect the power of a system like this is the number of pixels on the screen on your screen at every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a representation of the <unk> and not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure of having a real good experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a <unk> of a piece magazine .
we also have done something about this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve created a wrong ad with very high resolution resolution , which is much higher than in a normal display , and we added content content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is really reaching the ideas for the available place on the screen for the available place .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean any <unk> and other nonsense , means that this should not be necessary .
of course , that &apos;s a really obvious application for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
but these are all the streets in the <unk> .
<unk> up on top of the <unk> picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s take a little bit of it out .
now that &apos;s live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is actually two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which is a <unk> of caltech , a <unk> at the university of washington , under the counseling of steve <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that if we can actually create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through pictures and see this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial configuration of images is actually about it .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some things that are much more <unk> .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
so it &apos;s all <unk> , and you &apos;re all in perspective on this way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate with this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is from the <unk> to professional <unk> , a fairly large number of them that were all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
there &apos;s a number of photographs here , there &apos;s a number of photographs here .
this is actually a poster of the <unk> lady that was recorded right .
we can shift from a poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment -- it &apos;s now going to be collected data from all -- from the whole collective memory of what &apos;s looking like , visually the earth -- and everything will connect .
all these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of this to virtual earth to virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s using the user to use the user with the use of the user .
your own photos are going to <unk> with soft <unk> that one other person had entered .
and of course , of course , all of this is the immense virtual models of every interesting part of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not only been through <unk> or satellite and so forth , but through collective memory .
thank you .
am i going to get them right ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover .
if you want to make it <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of <unk> information that many of these pictures have .
how if you do a <unk> test for pictures where you enter sentences and in the website of the website , lots of information has a lot of information about what this image is .
but what if the picture is connected to all your images ?
and then the scope of <unk> <unk> and the abundance that make it that make it really is enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a few things about my book , and i &apos;m hoping to share with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try and make yourself a few connections if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works , when our goal is to maximize the <unk> of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the person .
the reason is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , useful , a <unk> premise for human human .
if people have freedom , then each of us for themselves to do things that will maximize the public , and nobody has to choose to decide .
so the way maximize freedom to maximize is to maximize .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
now , this is , i think , deep in our water supply , that there &apos;s no way that it would come to mind it .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples of what gives us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store for a stereo company -- speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in that an electronics , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> <unk> million different assets together into the components that are being offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , when i was a boy , and you wanted to have the <unk> of the <unk> bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was never broken the phone .
these days are over .
we have now almost an infinite choice , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be going soon .
and what does it do to make people walk into the business and make this question .
you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that &apos;s not too much doing .
in other aspects of life , the very much <unk> than that is to get objects , the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you : we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has got the benefits and risks .
what do they want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing marketing drug for people like you and me , and that , if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they promote if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , they &apos;re expecting to call us the next morning and ask a change the prescription .
so something like our identity is now a question of choice as a choice to show .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity ; we invent it .
and we &apos;re often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and that almost every one had a lot of time , and they were able to get kids as fast as they could .
the only choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and it &apos;s not because they are less carefully , not because they are very carefully .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids , or a career , do it ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether this means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do and not have good grade in my class .
and indeed , they should . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to be blessed by carl , which allows us to work every minute of every single day on the planet -- to work on the <unk> hotel .
so , by the way , there &apos;s actually a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about that <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making work , again and again , and again , we should be working , whether we should work or not work .
we can play a video of football game playing football , and we have our cell phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our own laptop is probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all shut down , every minute we &apos;re taking away from the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i go to this email ? should i write this letter ?
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; is certainly the experience of your child <unk> very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small stuff , material things is a matter of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there are some choices , but not everything was a choice of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , is the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to get what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
it &apos;s an effect , <unk> way , that it &apos;s <unk> instead .
with so many options that you can choose , people are very difficult to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , one study of investment in volunteers .
one person who had access to me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of a million collaborators , about 2,000 jobs jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent <unk> that led to employers , took the participation in a two percent .
they provide 50 percent of them -- 10 percent fewer staff than if they were only five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are going to be selection , it &apos;s so difficult to decide what to put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never comes .
by expanding it up to 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce your contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many options .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s all the eternity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment in the world , or even the wrong <unk> .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we get that paralysis and meet a decision , we end up with less content with the outcome of the choice , when we had the opportunity to choose between less options .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more opportunities there , the more simple there , the more there nothing to do , is disappointing to the choice they meet .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we measure things about , about what we &apos;re doing .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s just attractive to thinking about alternatives that you &apos;re aware of , it makes you less content with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not in new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of things .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they &apos;ve got it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn it says , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the mind <unk> that he missed the opportunity day , day a lot of time .
<unk> reduce happiness , which we get through our choice , as well as what we chose .
and the more opportunities for the choice , the more attractive properties of this sample are required in <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes a few statements .
it makes a statement about it now and maybe to do things slowly .
but a key thing that he &apos;s doing is always a matter of who you decide to decide to do other things .
and these other things like these other attractive animals , and it will be what they &apos;re doing less powerful .
three : the expectation of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
so to buy new jeans after many years of old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; you want to <unk> , easily <unk> or <unk> ?
do you want buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want holes with holes ?
you want to go far down far , <unk> , blah blah blah , &quot; and so on .
my pine tree was down after i recovered , i &apos;d like to say , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way the only species . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and tony &apos;s business -- and i tell the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better had it . all of these choices allowed me to do it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
and the reason that i felt worse was , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good couple of jeans is .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have some concrete expectations when it was in a way .
and when they came perfectly in 100 species , it &apos;s very damn .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was going to get in what i expected , and what i had was disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
the add of possibilities in the lives of human beings increases the expectations of how well people are going to be these opportunities .
and this leads to less happiness , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> it knows , because if you would , you know , you &apos;d all know about this .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that we used to be better than anything was worse than anything that was worse than anything that was worse to do experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
now , in the world where we live in the world -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , the best for you to hope to be the things that you &apos;re supposed to do .
you &apos;re never going to get pleasant because your expectations , your expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;re all coming to -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i am married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i don &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
if hundreds of various types of jeans are available , and they &apos;re the <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
and it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to ask .
you could have better do it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves ; they &apos;re blaming themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
and so this is the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think about , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , this is a little more selection better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow , that &apos;s more selection .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that very long time where we &apos;ve missed this problem .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a principle question , the thing about thinking is , what all these choices are in the industrialized societies is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you , whose problem isn &apos;t the problem of choice .
your problem is you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and <unk> is , steve <unk> has told you yesterday about it , and it &apos;s a waste of money , and it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they actually hurt .
it &apos;s that we &apos;re getting worse there .
if something of what makes people possible for our society to make societies come to people in their societies , not only would be the lives of human beings , but it would be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> will worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big selection is <unk> us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , it &apos;s not possible in the <unk> . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish know .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break it down , it &apos;s so that everything is possible down to it .
they raise the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost limited with perfect security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , <unk> .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by biology by creating new life and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand , and it &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to simplify it to the minimum components .
we have digitized nearly 20 years , when we sequenced the <unk> of the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now , what we &apos;re trying to do is we can regenerate , whether we can regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , who can replicate the smallest genome in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred genes of the 500 genes from the 500 or something .
so what we decided to do is we decided that the only way in front is this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and make some of that fundamental questions .
and so we started to think about the question , we can synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that had never been done ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps , our steps of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write about genetic code has been evolving very slowly , and yet increased , and our final point would sit on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it took actually a few years ago with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces and make the mistakes correct .
this was our first time , starting with digital information , the genome x x <unk> .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , and we made a <unk> molecule , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and <unk> bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released from the cells , and came back and killed e. <unk> .
i recently talked to the oil industry , and they said that this model was actually understood .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think this is actually a situation where the hardware can actually build your own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with information in the computer , this digital information is really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the <unk> had a mistake in 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 . if we used the original original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are built for 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with other <unk> pieces , so that they fit together .
we have a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have installed <unk> .
think about that : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t , t .
now , <unk> of this letter -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose of any of those amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences .
initially , we only signed .
some people were so disappointed that it was not a poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so we could just break them down with enzymes . there are enzymes the enzymes that repair these repair and put together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with that , starting with the five to <unk> letters , would put in each other to put them together to make these together up to <unk> .
in each one of the steps , we made these pieces in the surplus to sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with 100,000 pairs -- then this isn &apos;t just going to grow into e. <unk> . it &apos;s beyond the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we used to make different mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of <unk> <unk> that uses biology to repair dna that can put together these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
so , 12 to 24 hours later , everything has put together the way it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally <unk> , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space can exist in space and move to <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
so here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by this processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve used this processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve used to use them with the right design of the pieces of the pieces , and we have it automatically <unk> it .
this is not a <unk> it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is footage about a long length of seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve been doing recently .
this is about <unk> letters of <unk> code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule with <unk> structure made by people .
it &apos;s got a <unk> from over 300 million .
if we plot it from 10 and no distances of print , it would be <unk> pages , just to make this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s so much easier if you &apos;re in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out , and you have another one in it , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about this cloning .
in <unk> , the chromosome is the cell in the cell , but we have recently shown that you have a complete transplant of one cell to go from one cell to another , and that activate .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get something further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species that have a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every single time , thousands of characteristics in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that has lost a lot of the time in history .
there are enzymes called enzymes that are actually called dna digest .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no , the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added in .
it was <unk> in the cell , and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and we had only one cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
and all the proteins changed the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we went through .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can change the <unk> , things pretty dramatically .
now , i argued that this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years ago .
and i argued that we might be a new form of the <unk> explosion in which massive , new <unk> based on that digital design could be .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the process of six billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet today have existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh food and clean water , medicine , the fuel , for <unk> billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion barrels of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . this is a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from that material in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that this is the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we <unk> in first line of the biological reality , and that &apos;s the point of our imagination .
we have today , because we have technologies to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the possibility of building a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you &apos;re able to make these 20 different different kinds of genes or create these processes to optimize or create drugs new vaccines , we can change a little more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or so on .
that &apos;s a shot of actual <unk> that we &apos;re working with , which you actually sit down and create new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what they look like . we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have <unk> fuels in the <unk> and third generation that are relatively likely going to be much higher , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that we think of biology is a large impact on the cost of the cost or the limitation of their availability , when we &apos;re seeing co2 levels , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go on this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be thinking about the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 .
but in our finding the world , we have all sorts of different kinds of things .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , with almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 from methane to methane as being hydrogen .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon dioxide that could just be brought to <unk> , <unk> co2 in the fuel to drive that process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ? a <unk> of the energy .
but the same thing that we &apos;re working on now is the same way for developing vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year from the back , and we have a dollar in the back of it , when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that this can be changed by <unk> vaccines in <unk> vaccines .
this is what the future might look like with changes , it can accelerate now , and it &apos;s accelerating , and perhaps <unk> .
we are moving away from people to improve humans , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to you to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s all about this , and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the lhc , the lhc has the greatest scientific experiment ever published -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a second of the universe -- and it &apos;s like 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine geneva by geneva .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these <unk> detectors in detectors .
that &apos;s what i work on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you see the scale .
september last year , the machine was going to go for the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
there &apos;s huge differences in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is the entire track for the lhc , then intentional with a part of the lhc , to <unk> a rain from particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest <unk> , or this , when somebody went to google side , and the front page was found .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the science .
now , about a week later , there was a problem with the machine later on .
these are wires <unk> <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
well , the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; no , no . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford to do this because if you &apos;re very far cool , you &apos;re going to be called <unk> .
so , minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these are wires can stand .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and so , the wires , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , met <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
well , this is still <unk> when you think that magnets weigh over 20 tons and a half inches .
so , we &apos;re about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect first data in june or july , and put on our journey , and sit down our journey to the building of the universe .
well , of course , a kind of spark of crashes again , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject anything .
and i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond our borders , make the value of things like the lhc .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect to change that .
however , recent recent is something interesting in my life and my career has happened that i have brought me to think completely .
the result is that i am , no matter where i &apos;m going to be treated like the doom of death .
seriously -- close to the doom !
so , for example , they &apos;re very concerned about me and say , &quot; well , don &apos;t you fear that success ?
have you not been afraid of your entire life , and you &apos;re never going to create a book that anyone in the world is interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really the power .
people said , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re not afraid to have success ?
do you have no fear that you kill you the humiliation of a <unk> ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to <unk> your life for your life , and you &apos;re never going to die and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of the failure ? &quot;
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;m going to be afraid of some more things that nobody would do .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this recently , and why ?
is that sensible ?
is it obvious that by someone &apos;s supposed to be expected to do that , he &apos;s afraid to do the jobs ?
and what about the creative enterprises begin to make us feel more about the relationship of the state -- in a way that they don &apos;t do professions ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remind myself in his 40 years as a chemist to remember if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists are not given the call of <unk> people &apos;s reputation .
but we writers seem to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , they seem to have this reputation of being incredibly unstable .
all you have to do is to look at the bitter <unk> <unk> of really great minds alone , the young and a lot of hand died .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have <unk> , seemed to be very neglected to their real talent .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview
a extraordinary statement that they can do about their life work .
the question i want to ask everyone here is : is this idea for them all right ?
if you think about it ? because only one centimeter , i feel like i am not comfortable with this notion .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch her in the next century .
i find it better if we encourage our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation -- very dangerous , very dangerous , to start with this dark path of thought -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now about the world &apos;s work as the work is being judged by the last <unk> of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s <unk> because we &apos;re all sort of like friends -- it &apos;s most likely that my greatest success of mine lies .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this is the kind of thought that you can get to get nine o &apos;clock in the morning to start drink gin . and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of <unk> , i seems to write a way to write a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
so somehow i have to find a way to find a way to write a safe distance from my point of view and my very natural <unk> , like the reaction to the writing .
this quest for me to greece and the old rome .
please join me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the ancient greece and over rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity is coming from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of a <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source of man , which comes out of people -- <unk> , unknown , reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> <unk> regime .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he thought he was supposed to have a <unk> that <unk> him from further distance .
the roman was the same idea that we called the <unk> creative mind , a <unk> genius <unk> .
this is great . the roman thought was a really genius that was a very bright individual .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s a distance , that &apos;s the distance from the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of <unk> was certain things , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at you all look at you guys , everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational system , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual individual .
for the first time in history , you &apos;re listening to people or those who call genius , you know , instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that these <unk> have wiped out our artists last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t do this for 500 years of <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of the notion of -- fundamentally -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as everything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was that i &apos;ve been hearing the absolute <unk> of the creative process .
a process that has been -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever been trying to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always , always .
in fact , in fact , he can feel <unk> .
she would say it was like a <unk> train .
that &apos;s what it was about to put on her country .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that they could only do one thing , one , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part will never forget -- she said that moments in them were almost missed .
she caught the poem on its tail and moved it back into her body and took it to the sheet of paper .
at this opportunity , the poem was <unk> and intact , intact , but backwards from the last word .
when i heard that , i thought this was creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i &apos;m going to have to stand up at the same time every day and sweat , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable with <unk> and really uncomfortable .
but even i have this thing in my lab , sometimes this thing is <unk> .
and i appreciate that many of you have done that .
and even i had work or ideas , which i can really &apos;t identify .
what is this thing for ?
and how do we deal with that relationship without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example is , how do you create this a musician with tom <unk> . i could interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom impulses , the embodiment of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to master and help them help .
but then he was older and calm down . he told me that he was one day on a <unk> in los angeles , and then everything changed .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so , he starts to get these old <unk> in him , like <unk> , and i &apos;m going to be tracked by that song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just stopped .
and he finished all the <unk> and doing something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you see that i &apos;m driving ? <unk> <unk> .
and i look at this as a song about this as a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> is somebody else .
walk and <unk> leonard cohen . <unk> cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed the whole .
it &apos;s not the work itself . it was often as dark as ever ever .
it could be a <unk> , wondrous , bizarre work , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing , which wasn &apos;t entirely tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of how i worked , and it &apos;s been saved me .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i was just supposed to <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i talked to my comment on an empty corner of the room .
i said , &quot; oh , listen , you guys , you know , you and i both know if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely true , right ?
because you see , i &apos;ve got investing . i don &apos;t have investing more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and you have to get your percentage of money .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell you do .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you the record , give me that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following the following , centuries ago , in the deserts , <unk> people to <unk> people who were <unk> for hours -- to dawn .
these have been great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the characters was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen you have a performance like this .
it was as if it was time and the dancers of a kind of <unk> <unk> , and he did nothing differently when he ever did it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything made up .
and all of a sudden he appeared no longer in human human being .
it &apos;s been <unk> from the inside and down from the bottom , and it &apos;s all <unk> fire .
when something happened then , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
if you have a performer in spain , something magical has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancer wakes themselves up and shows 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday is -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go up to those heights .
and maybe someone will never name any of god &apos;s name if it turns out , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> of of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning of their existence by them .
if you just think that you &apos;re down to a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> source for an <unk> time of your life that somebody else &apos;s passed on if you &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with safety of the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to be coming out soon -- when dangerous , frightening , strongly expected to success from my <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
what i have to say constantly to say about this , if i &apos;m going to be mad , is not afraid .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
however , for your contribution to your contribution , whatever you will be .
if your job dance is dance .
if the dumb divine genius that will give you to the side is decides to take a kind of a kind of wonder of wonder by your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> <unk> ! <unk> .
and if not , yet , your dance yet .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you for yourself .
i believe that , i feel like we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you for granted , just that you have the mere human love and the <unk> <unk> for that .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed the two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> size , which had been around for nearly three million years in order to get 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press very enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick of ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> is the blind heart of our global heart attacks .
it grows in the winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> thing in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red marks .
as you can see , it grows to the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which out here .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming of frozen the frozen ocean , where it &apos;s large amounts of <unk> carbon , which is where , when it comes to carbon , from microbes that are being applied to methane .
compared with the whole amount of <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere , it could double the amount of it if we cross that critical period .
already today <unk> in alaska , methane from itself in alaska , methane from itself .
professor <unk> <unk> at the university in alaska with another group of <unk> the other flat sea in alaska .
wow !
it &apos;s fine . the question is , how will it go .
and one reason is , this enormous heat spike heats up greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is far bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea sea levels are , they &apos;re going into the ocean .
these rivers take place slowly .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month of researchers , the researchers signed up a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed up over a few <unk> is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up new lakes , which was glacier a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you <unk> , most of the water is <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in sierra leone was in the sierra leone .
this is <unk> .
and the predictions of how they read they &apos;re serious .
these <unk> in the world will lead to a dramatic increases on fire .
and the disasters all around the world have been <unk> , and it &apos;s never been an unprecedented degree .
four times as many times in the last 30 years like this .
this is an entirely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years we have 70 million tons of co2 emissions every 24 hours -- 25 million tons per day in the oceans .
so , look at the eastern pacific area , the american continent west , and <unk> of indian continent , where there &apos;s a radical decline in the oceans .
the largest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which 20 percent is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the lowest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two major <unk> <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
these are the ones that were taken out over the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there is a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> last <unk> spending on reducing clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me something .
for christmas , i went home to my home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas day .
one of the commercials of the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy guy .
it &apos;s in the skin and plenty of america in america , and it helps our economy .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain in wages and bread .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clearly . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has written in terms of the two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
and so we set ourselves up to the top of the <unk> , a significant significant <unk> spent to spend a <unk> on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also a good smell .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave it to us .
<unk> coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern of the modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of one of the main reasons for the global warming is global warming , the remarkably clean <unk> that you see here , changes .
look at that , this is the place today , clean <unk> .
and finally , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge , is to the national security challenge .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that we &apos;re all connecting together is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free , to free ourselves from this <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
so , a plan that comes back to work to make us safer , and help stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence upon the old , messy <unk> that are <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments for creating a good job .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , walk alone .
if you want to go far , walk together . &quot;
we need to get far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
so i &apos;d like to start asking you to take your childhood <unk> when you were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to make the hands out , and <unk> <unk> , they actually learned to think and moves through the understanding , to try to solve the problems and solve things .
the spatial thing is closely related to how much of our environment understand .
this question was so emotional that we decided to explore and we developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be moving with your hand , you can detect each other , you can capture your motions , and you have a screen and a stick .
much more important , physically , are so physically , why you can get them just like <unk> and access to your hands .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation digital data .
and when these resources are being physical and an awareness of their movements , to see each other , and the subtleties of our <unk> with them , we can start to study new and entertaining <unk> .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is going to be <unk> , and if i <unk> it into a direction , the video will play forward , and if i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side with each other , that &apos;s their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you can find that and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and they bend .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like color like that with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re mixed with .
if we <unk> it , we can <unk> .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we can give people the opportunity of the fast trial and the results you want to see .
this is me -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m modeling <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you &apos;re going to end up using a <unk> , and you &apos;re trying to make words , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;re going to read a dictionary .
then , about 30 seconds , again , <unk> , and you have a new <unk> , and you try new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try and get a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
there are some people who are testing it .
this is our youngest <unk> at the bottom right there .
it turns out he was just a pile of <unk> the <unk> .
so they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters in the scene by the way he <unk> the <unk> from the table to the table .
this is a <unk> the sun .
the sun goes up on the sun .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> , and it can put the characters together ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have time to show it is to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve developed recently and <unk> as sound , <unk> , <unk> and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can see these sounds in the sequence of the sequence that can be <unk> in any sequence .
and you put it in just by a way to put a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change , like hall and filters .
you put it together with a particular tone , and it tends to make it .
and then <unk> effects like pace and volume , which you apply to the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re going to start adding the <unk> into two <unk> , and we &apos;re adding it to a row , and then you expand and add a little more to the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something more drums .
and i just hook the drums up with the drums that i can control the effect live .
i can speed the whole sequence of speed up the speed , which is the speed for one or another .
and i &apos;ll just hook up the filters again for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as you change .
so i don &apos;t have to plan for them at the end , but can improvise , they can extend it down .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence of the sequence by the <unk> .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire to develop new <unk> that are better to work on how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you some of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re doing in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of <unk> interacting with digital media that can bring information into our world , the demands of our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m delighted that i am there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i &apos;ve got to first step back to molecular molecular biology , and it &apos;s busy with the modern molecular molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology for a few years now with the <unk> , and that &apos;s what i learned because i just wanted to know , and everything even wanted to do anything i &apos;ve learned in the study of today .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i somehow wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think the molecular biology in general now , generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count about , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now is extremely important , and much , much more , is going to become more important in the future .
there are things like these <unk> <unk> all the plants on the <unk> .
there are now craig venter in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> .
there &apos;s also some things that are going to come up with all the rest of the day , which is most people don &apos;t realize , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are genetically <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue on and on .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to keep growing up on this technology .
so now why are now <unk> ?
most people know most of the people know this from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and then it becomes the media , yes , the hacker breaks somewhere somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad to the <unk> , because it &apos;s not what it is like that what it really started and what it &apos;s really about .
and in fact , the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , started <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and it &apos;s got it up to software , but there &apos;s a lot of software , but there &apos;s also a whole <unk> , and there &apos;s a whole <unk> , which is all kinds of <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also code , and so you can also program it to <unk> it , and so i found that i find an incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot more deeper .
it actually has just been <unk> eight forms of those networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , that &apos;s originally from switzerland , that is originally from switzerland and with a cooperation in india , but there are now members or active people everywhere in the world .
but it &apos;s always about trying to find this way that you can have access to this kind of confidence that you have to do with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more kind of kind of a forum , where you &apos;re looking at it and online .
they &apos;re a little bit of an engineering approach , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to be <unk> questions .
and based on that networks that the whole popular thing has done , it has evolved a scene that i &apos;d like to take a little bit of time .
here in the upper left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a school kind of school , a private school , non-profit association , where everyone can .
so , kids , old , all kinds of people go through it , just a lab , and look at what can you do when these <unk> go .
down here on the left is a group in indonesia , which means that there &apos;s a pretty long time .
more than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also engaging in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and yes , also , <unk> , and combine it in a pretty artistic aspect .
and i have a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in the medical field with an exhibition on the subject .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s most pretty young people , but the only thing that all of which is what everybody &apos;s united and this fascination is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and really focus on society with it , and ask questions , ok , what do you want to do , you have to engage with your interest ?
so , okay , to <unk> biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you &apos;re looking at in a lab , which is sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , very <unk> , <unk> academics , and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , well , that actually doesn &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because each every one of each <unk> has actually increased technology as most of the <unk> technology , which is really that .
and the premise of that premise , with that premise , has been trying to have brian <unk> in england , an <unk> <unk> , then has been a <unk> , and then has taken a <unk> , <unk> , and then brought bacteria .
so everybody , once again , a soup of soup , which has dropped to a long time .
i was trying to do this in my lab , trying to scale a little bit of scale , and then take me to buy a little <unk> on ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so that &apos;s the way to do it at home .
and this is <unk> , which is just mentioned <unk> , that yeah , kind of , kind of a <unk> of molecular biology .
and yeah , so you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that there are people who are doing home alone up to home to the big ones , and so much larger organizations , which are even more likely to do in <unk> form .
and then , it &apos;s also about , okay , who are we , okay , what we want to do ?
and what are our values and what are our goals , what are our goals ?
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> out of that .
so this was kind of intuitive , so everyone just got this way , and what it &apos;s going to do is put it in , then .
it came , my mind , a very good code .
and then we &apos;re not engaged in this , but it &apos;s really , i think , has been quite good at it , people are quite convinced .
and we actually tried to get it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so , i think , in fact , we &apos;re in the <unk> , in terms of the <unk> world .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
a project that i &apos;ve done with the <unk> in switzerland even was a so-called optical trap , or optical <unk> .
this is down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then the laser <unk> the laser and then tries to focus on this camera .
and , unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of things .
this is another project from the french group , from paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like to do , so it &apos;s such a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so he has been dealing with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
and he then built this helmet , and in the cooperation building this helmet , it went on .
and then they could go in the room in the room , sit on this helmet , sit on this helmet .
and then they were measured , and depending on what they thought , or as they &apos;ve thought , they were different lights on space .
a pretty pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which is also about to do with this <unk> , is that the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to replicate gene , to reproduce , <unk> , fragments of fragments that can make you visible .
and the machines that make this kind of stuff , they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy the least expensive that you buy .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can too do much .
so this is just an application of a lot that you can do with it .
i think , somehow , six hundred dollars , or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s <unk> .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
one project i had started to do was build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like such a kind of <unk> , which shoots one kind of <unk> , two centimeters or something .
you <unk> <unk> on <unk> and then the <unk> <unk> into these <unk> , and then i went on <unk> and then made it <unk> .
so the device that you see is that it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype , which has looked at it , but it has looked at so on a branch , it was on a branch of it , and that was the pressure that was broken up .
and then i took a <unk> and that &apos;s connected .
a <unk> , if you do full of water , have the enough pressure , so i think 40 to the <unk> bar about it .
and then you can get the particles strong enough faster , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euro or something , <unk> <unk> for 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , right now , this is the <unk> of the scene at the moment that the availability of technology to increase , and also the information and the <unk> , that are more people who can get engaged .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a very little clue of this , and also there &apos;s no chance to make it really good .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make useful decisions in society , and you want to make good decisions in society and the conversation , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you can understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> open source of the <unk> open and citizen science .
so , you know , as a citizen , you &apos;re going to be able to spread through these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of <unk> .
these are the people who have registered at at least officially <unk> website .
this is quite a remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think that there are fewer people on the ground than actually exist .
so i know from some people who don &apos;t have registered .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and partly , with these <unk> , these places , these places together .
and that &apos;s very , very beginning .
as i said , it was just beginning to have .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and that &apos;s now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> who are represented throughout the world .
and of course , we &apos;re hoping that we tend to expand the way , and then they &apos;re very similar to all sorts of things , so that we can take people involved .
and i invite you to be watching , and even once myself , what do you try .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , then you get there too much .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moved to me as a designer , but also in the realm of <unk> <unk> and all of the things in the field of user experience .
so it &apos;s about how you see people in interactive media so that they can use interactive media , and so they can create an important experience .
and i believe that the interactive media is within us <unk> , cognitive models , <unk> , which is in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can only generate through interactive media .
and this is quite amazing , because in fact you think that these <unk> things that are actually going to happen to the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is right in our future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future of the future .
so what are these <unk> models now ?
i &apos;ve written four <unk> and i &apos;d like to explain to you briefly .
to <unk> cognitive models , these are the models that we &apos;ve pointed in the smallest times .
so to this <unk> models , we &apos;ve heard a basically natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds very unusual .
now , i &apos;m going to go back to the point , and i &apos;m going to show you by trying to prove a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since of these <unk> models , that &apos;s very , very simple to speak , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains , actually , is itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition <unk> , which is the <unk> of the linearity , and what of course tells us is that the linearity is normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
what is this with virtuality now which is actually the most natural thing about the world .
i want to prove to you .
how many doors have the house where you live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that spontaneous , spontaneous , but it &apos;s going to happen here , right now .
they go through this house through this house , in <unk> them , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they <unk> the reality , it &apos;s a very , very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so , there &apos;s a little bit of trouble giving us the virtual reality in the <unk> , so we can actually do this all the time .
and that this wealth of reality is to <unk> the virtual reality of the <unk> , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have a books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had been their head .
and in this head , the memory goes off .
in this head , knowledge <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination had been passed on knowledge .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality as well .
the interesting thing is , if i can do a small trip .
yeah .
the interesting thing is that at this time , the man at the same time is <unk> and media itself .
now , if you keep a little bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given change .
but i &apos;ll come back to that again .
it &apos;s been a <unk> tool since always <unk> .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , called <unk> , to protect knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re still dependent on very , very strong .
the author of the book <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to <unk> , we still <unk> hours hours with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s going to be able to reach most of the time that the most <unk> of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now , we think our love depends on stories that we were as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s a lot further back , in the pre-industrial cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as a particularly impressive media , we have defined by a se in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i &apos;ve brought one example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , from island to island to raise food .
and they did this with the so-called <unk> .
you know , maybe you &apos;re going to know a little bit about it , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in it .
they have similar principles .
they have no <unk> , but they have used this as <unk> <unk> or also <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is , is that the navigation , and the topography of regions of these regions could be mapped .
where the language was <unk> <unk> , it was <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and rhythm .
and these sound and the rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and that &apos;s , of course , is able to allow those songs and then go back to the left , to the right , to the right , to the right , to the right , too .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore , to get up from the top of a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happened to the <unk> age machine .
we &apos;ve been moving into what &apos;s called a <unk> .
what happened is the machine age and happening is the book , and it &apos;s happened to be the <unk> .
and that is that this is happening that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book , and on the image .
so , unfortunately , we have a bit of god to <unk> god .
now , virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
the <unk> for the age of age .
what caused our influence on our thinking and our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> forces are the <unk> of the arab cultures .
and they &apos;re in the course of centuries more and more <unk> had been through the shock of <unk> .
so , that means we have a lot to remember , we have standardized , very common , a lot of common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
we have an abstract <unk> language .
we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to do it anymore in pictures , but we don &apos;t <unk> them in pictures of our language .
we &apos;ve got used to that thing linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as the rule , and there are only exceptions , as for example .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;ve been arrested for the <unk> as a <unk> very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called <unk> call .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very much like science fiction .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which allow us to get these things back to us again .
it &apos;s about virtuality ; it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to just explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts like , for example , the <unk> reality , which is the extended reality .
and so , of course , <unk> of my talk , that may sound like we don &apos;t have in existing existing economies , virtual worlds , to the model of the <unk> .
and other examples are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all this ability to accept our ability to accept virtuality is a real habitat .
i &apos;m at degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
you might be going to get up for a minute , so you can get yourself in the pause for the project .
and this project , i &apos;ve brought along with the example of how again that <unk> , cognitive models will be addressed .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
and of course , what <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i &apos;m computer games , you probably have a very likely point in front of eyes that any people would get people in front of some kind of <unk> or that they &apos;re playing with any <unk> in the hand .
anyway , you can do that in there .
this is a game for out .
and that &apos;s what i think that i think is the outside world , so i discover the physical world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the virtual world is the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize to me , i apologize to it .
you can do it much better , there &apos;s still a lot more about it .
and it &apos;s about finding a city where i &apos;m looking at places in which places are positive or negative .
and so i get from the city of a whole different sight , which is a whole different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city and a way to get a whole different virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at now .
ah , what you can see here is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing in the same way .
of course , this virtual world walls in our urban walls is really clear .
and with some kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked by whether this bag has been a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about that instead .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate what &apos;s in there .
but i &apos;m just going to do a little bit more curious .
yes , children are from nature curious , or rather than being curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a <unk> of the house , so i &apos;m also , of course , with the subject of the curiosity , and how do we think again , and why we might lose , and so on , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with in the actual existence of existence .
if professors are becoming curious , then they tend to <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a <unk> on the subject natural user interface interface with design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the sudden you &apos;re going to start with the natural world , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and there i &apos;m only one of these little devices , because things are always more intuitive , more and more intuitive , and you have to look at what &apos;s really important to us , which is actually to be , of course , for us , of course , and intuitive .
so , i &apos;ve got to deal with it , of course , and intuitively .
maybe even a look at this .
why does this matter ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , it &apos;s just shown here , and then we &apos;re going to move away from the third to the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through language .
that means you &apos;ve been able to come up with a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate with one another , or in other areas , cities , creating cities , or villages , has created a way to create a <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , a little bit of a living .
you also had to learn , you know , not a smartphone can come from nature , but we &apos;re learning it <unk> and private course .
that became the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> <unk> in form , which is called <unk> and alive , i &apos;m going to start , and i &apos;ll start it in stone , and i &apos;m going to use it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s of course a different number , as if there is a living one of a living .
but then <unk> was going to pull off the script as <unk> .
and then the next generation where we &apos;re actually mostly living .
this is just using pressure and <unk> <unk> script and others .
at the time , it &apos;s just a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , are you really insane when the people are starting to read , then the later , and this is , of course , <unk> .
and of course , that completely , of course , because we see on one side the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
and these two worlds are just pop , new and old .
and the exciting thing about this is when you look at this guy , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and a <unk> paradigm .
but now not at the local level , but it &apos;s a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that is the global ecology of ecology .
not when i think local , and the neighbor is less green , then it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that means , from the local village , is actually a global village with the same principles , as well , as well as intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village , who did what , and when you know , it &apos;s happening today about these <unk> of our self from a global scale .
is it that we know globally , and it &apos;s always faster and better and better .
as it used to be on the village .
now , in front of the background , i &apos;ve been busy looking at what &apos;s going on , what does it mean for us , what does it mean for us , which is , well , what are we going to do , but what makes the difference ?
because often , you can &apos;t get people , you know , they &apos;re not going to deal with it .
so , you have to deal with it , because it &apos;s not just that , and not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s better to be better .
you know , you &apos;re busy , as well as the student , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and , of course , that &apos;s what you &apos;re starting to look and look at , and look , okay , now i just look at the inner self .
and what does it actually look like ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
and what does that actually mean , intuitively , and how do our channels work of perception , and how does it work ?
it &apos;s because steve jobs would say it <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at detail when i want to make some <unk> or intuitively <unk> , which is in the nucleus .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
so , information is the difference that makes a difference .
now , many use of the word , but actually it &apos;s not what it means of detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding information is going to be information , when it comes from information , and from information , i know how to get things up , and of course , i can do things as well , or of course .
and of course , how does design impact on perception .
so a lot of natural , in a vessel , but i &apos;m going to see right , where is salt and pepper and pepper .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , and then when it comes to the right idea , where it &apos;s inside .
and the left just intuitively , and i hope , and i hope that no sugar is there , the salt .
but also , our perceptions themselves , how makes you mind you .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle of circle looks taller than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re so large , and yet , our perceptions , our perceptions , depending on what context what context is .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on it .
<unk> <unk> should be working .
there &apos;s going to be some of my glasses .
so , it &apos;s &apos; n .
a second circle starts to touch certain resemblance or associate .
this is what &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the designers , they usually have the first <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> nearby , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
in third , you &apos;ve forgotten .
but that &apos;s an essential important component to if you want things to create even more intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also interesting is looking at it .
so first of all , first of all , it &apos;s very banal , but very exciting about it .
so we have the eyes , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;ll see in front of the back .
because they <unk> an assumption that they see something that you see , <unk> circle .
and that means we &apos;re <unk> our vision before we see it again in the back of our <unk> back to the back of our <unk> to say , okay .
i have <unk> cognitive <unk> , you have what you have to do , what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , again , that comes back .
and then you go back to the front , because the back is not what you &apos;re looking at at the front , and don &apos;t say , look at what you &apos;re looking at .
and then goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s really just seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how things are happening , and what are the things that happen to happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now , everyone is trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what &apos;s recognized .
does anyone see something ?
a <unk> , exactly .
if i saw that that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , then you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now look at the <unk> .
and now , you can see it always .
this is , i &apos;ve actually <unk> them now , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern of <unk> , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short time in a very short period of time .
and this is the projection of seeing , <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to know , and now i &apos;m going to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
all right , very exciting processes that then , you know , gray process is actually not , but here in this <unk> mass , that &apos;s just happening .
does anybody know what three seconds is ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present time .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know about it , three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present , then i can also get very well very well <unk> , where i &apos;m going to do it by three seconds .
that &apos;s what it has to do as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can get a very elegant <unk> , for example , when i know that phenomenon .
what does <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s where you fall in love .
this means even if you know that now , you &apos;re looking at how long , you &apos;re looking at how long , you know , because i don &apos;t get <unk> , which can happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s where most of the perceptions we have .
that means that this first thing is happening in a very rapidly fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re paying attention to , and how we &apos;re going to protect ourselves from our environment , so we can turn that forward .
of course , the designers don &apos;t deal with the issue of perceptions and neural <unk> or neural <unk> , but of course , primarily with the topic of <unk> .
so , like a human being , with certain things .
so , there is a little bit of behavioral functions , so it &apos;s kind of <unk> things , so <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where to reach .
now , there are also symbolic features , why don &apos;t you have a little bit of a <unk> , where does hardly matter any <unk> , so <unk> <unk> sums of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more on the <unk> , on the <unk> that we are as a <unk> of course .
back to my actual subject natural user interface interface and the topic , of course , which , of course , <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> means , how can i get a certain goal at a certain goal , or how can you get a user in a particular <unk> , efficient and <unk> one goal .
this is what it says is the norm .
how can i make a difference ?
can i do that directly or need i need &apos; n , or i need , i know , i need an excellent training .
and fewer <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s .
that i &apos;m just making the difference and make it beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and this is an intuitive <unk> , not first of all of the apple <unk> of elementary particles , <unk> of elementary technology , when i just want to make technological devices .
why ?
because in the general we &apos;re using this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user interface , for example , is five times faster on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something about classical <unk> , you need to need five hours of software , you need to use this new kind of natural software for one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours , but your employers , or anybody , you know , it &apos;s going to take you for four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , that it &apos;s a major event for us to do some things .
if we go back to the piece of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where we took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that we &apos;ve got to do with this is the next <unk> model or the mental model of the software model , they have worked a little bit , the metaphor of a desktop , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so no longer , they &apos;re not a metaphor or ones , and they &apos;re a metaphor .
that &apos;s all done , well , but it &apos;s a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is working a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m making a lot more of the behavior as a change that looks very much more often than this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i mean that this is always a <unk> for success in the success , which is a <unk> .
and when i &apos;m going to take a step up into these natural user interfaces , where i <unk> by voice , by speech , by speech , by gesture , by definition , by gesture , and not more mouse and mouse , then i &apos;m even faster and <unk> .
but that leads me to the point again , when are the things going to be really more intuitive to be more intuitive ?
now , if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to put my little friend out here and see , what does that mean , from the point of view of <unk> , when now is really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always intuitive for us to think about , if i have to think about it as well .
so apparently he doesn &apos;t like to think , but they &apos;re just going to make their financial .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does this mean for designers ?
so , if we look at that , we can put existing output from one another to something else , for example , for example , the metaphor , then i can handle that as designers .
that means i can just put an intuitive , human <unk> on a software program , and the software that is doing the software is essential .
now , of course , the question , of course , is the question of human beings , and now i have to tell you .
this is what we call <unk> .
this is using each of us , and <unk> is an acronym and stands for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s all the power of you all the time , but it does unconsciously , and you &apos;re kind of intuitive , and it &apos;s also instinctively instinctively .
the model is already being used in the womb , and is <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by us all the time , without knowing that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about fifty to <unk> times of the activity of the brain , so in the sleep , you realized that there &apos;s less often a lot of <unk> than the day .
i can now be able to <unk> this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> in a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , but now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a metaphor of a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> metaphor .
and then i can transfer this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
now , you &apos;ve got pies .
<unk> : now i &apos;m kind of <unk> up with the object , <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole whole aspect of this , now , let &apos;s filter it and say , just show me all of the things .
and have a interface like that , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and the curiosity does not make you learn .
that &apos;s why everybody who &apos;s here are and curious is , in fact , people who have a property that they don &apos;t learn .
what i &apos;m going to do is virtually this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central part of this .
and it &apos;s on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they add + two grams phosphorus , and every day they have to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
we could just slide out as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
if we did no phosphorus and make it phosphorus .
it &apos;s so amazing that we &apos;re doing something about this , which is actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not that .
because everybody talks about energy , but no one talks about energy .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only taken for two years , and now we &apos;re going to have a lot of more uranium in the world than in all the world &apos;s environment is used to be used in the environment .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> tons of uranium on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s making leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , driving less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
that &apos;s not protection .
this is how if i would say , your child would blow it just three times of five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> process to the <unk> , then our entire earth sooner or later a <unk> .
that &apos;s why we have the <unk> to think about <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as first .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the land is stored .
now we &apos;re building corn , and we &apos;re going to lose corn and 30 pounds of 30 tons per hectare , or <unk> <unk> .
that means we &apos;re going to lose more time in the ground five five five thousand times .
we can of course see the <unk> look .
and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like that .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> are <unk> by now <unk> .
and because we get older , it will be larger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re in the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby takes about six thousand <unk> .
we could reduce this of of course 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is in china in a second balanced .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these <unk> ?
this is one of the proof that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus of the piano is going to be emitted through the solid components .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is the <unk> , right ?
traditionally we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you tell people that when you get people to <unk> it if you &apos;re saying that , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> to stabilize than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a human being <unk> , you &apos;ll see the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then they weigh the ants about four times more than we people .
i could use termites , but in the united states , nobody might take termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that ants weigh much more than us .
and because they physically work much harder than we , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re equivalent to their weight , 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we are too stupid , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ? one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that <unk> is going to be like a trees , right ?
yes ?
a tree is not a tree .
luckily not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> on trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees alone .
have you heard about some of the <unk> trees ?
that means all our intelligence is going to be <unk> as a trees .
and where you see , even with something like <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> .
every year we lose three million tons that would really go back into the cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about this .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re guilty of as guilty of the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you &apos;re all <unk> that allow our own feces .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s good to be less harmful , less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to minimize a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest , not being there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shot off , you would have taken emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in the brazil of where we take the nutrients away .
right , we can be able to do that in agriculture , <unk> nutrients .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re directly taking the waste of it .
in china , in china , is a <unk> , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
this means that the entire western <unk> draws out that the city always has taken off , but the farmers never got back .
so the cities needed to grow more and more , because the farmers went to cities and cities had to keep their resources away .
and so all of the western empires are always expanding , until they get the infrastructure more and more and more .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five years , because you always have been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat the food , you would expect food to be , until you look at the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to go and ride to nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to dinner , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet , how to get the nutrients back .
and the great thing about it is that the <unk> in the favelas around ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , so we don &apos;t have to be bad at all .
we can support them well .
so , of course , that &apos;s <unk> , but the plants themselves are carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design , which is a farmer you can easily manage .
that means that the <unk> go back .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been <unk> .
you could just be able to <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then the device would be ruins over years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , as well as bad enough .
we can support them well .
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re in germany , in germany , in germany , in the best <unk> .
but unfortunately not in <unk> , but maybe you can do the <unk> in a little bit .
because the <unk> block could be the best back .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it really works .
we &apos;ve been deployed in holland for three years .
the dutch government explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world what phosphorus <unk> .
but we need it overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of <unk> control .
and the oil is going to replace us with other fuel .
but you &apos;re not going to replace phosphorus .
it &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad sad , if you have it , if you have them <unk> , and they come with fifty <unk> .
very inefficient .
but very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six <unk> of three kilograms of their lives .
here .
this is not scientifically accurate because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> it is .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , can i tell you , is totally inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
a lot of what is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not a resource efficiency , but efficiency .
asking questions , what is the right ?
not to burn a little bit better , and to burn it , and do it <unk> and <unk> all the materials to lose all the materials for the boat , but first of all , how much do you make ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a green in the south .
no , that &apos;s just the right , yes ?
in every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , you can do it again .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
as we think of north .
there &apos;s every footprint that &apos;s footprint .
if you walk , yes , almost every footprint the soil is .
because the soil is going to die , and the wind , and the wind and the water is washing away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everybody means that the water footprint is that the water remains in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , what about your wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , <unk> .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like people in the high bow <unk> of the car .
because , you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a picture of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , there we go .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> process , which is in room .
they can go and stand where they are .
in two hours , they &apos;re building themselves .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they allow them to contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all of it should be <unk> .
a <unk> or a washing machine that doesn &apos;t use it .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that they have to go to biological systems .
the things that are used to be used in technical systems .
but we just talk today about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all directly ads , and not for the company <unk> per se , but they &apos;re now helping to make these products to succeed .
because we don &apos;t do things we don &apos;t do .
yes ?
so , when i go to dinner and say , it &apos;s free from <unk> , then helps you nothing .
no , we &apos;re stuck in there .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic up toxic .
it &apos;s everything that is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can do with the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> and the rubber in biological cycles , right ?
all of it is <unk> of it .
and if we succeed , it &apos;s of course for <unk> , for nike , for nike and <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> worldwide that will be caused by the textile industry .
so , you &apos;re helping them with , ask for the people .
hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
because now they &apos;ve got the <unk> changed now .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really <unk> .
so let me help you a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s been presented with just what &apos;s presented .
that &apos;s .
we can now do things like this , when they &apos;re <unk> , if they can <unk> , you can see in biological cycles .
technical cycles are the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> on this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s going to go back in the circulation .
and so , in any store , you can do things like this .
if you come on that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
now , when the waste is the waste .
all over the <unk> , it &apos;s almost almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the <unk> , but also in the landscape , right ?
yes ?
if they take these <unk> , they <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , to plant trees .
so this is the baby <unk> for the whole life of the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started an institute .
now there are a lot of people working with them , and they can all work .
there &apos;s extra chips in it , which can be <unk> where everybody can participate .
so no longer saving , not eliminating , avoid reducing , no <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it matter ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i &apos;m writing as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so in the english community .
<unk> are english of the written notes in <unk> music .
already , from the german to translating english into english , it can require more knowledge , and when it comes to poetry , it &apos;s about poetry .
it &apos;s very strange for terms in terms of terms , which we musicians to do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just launched the written notes .
they think of the composer that the composer has seen everything that he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same or <unk> , like a verbal , when very seemingly <unk> <unk> , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> , the smell of flowers is not to smell the flowers , not to see the level of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
that means that the interpreter has to put these <unk> data on a different , which is a different kind of <unk> , concrete <unk> translate .
today i want to share with you what else i say , so <unk> , <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so , basically one translation of translation is in translation .
so i put it in front of the way that you &apos;d rather be in german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be the translation for me to translate to the translation of translation in translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> grades , the function of the letters .
so it &apos;s not going to take just reading notes , and those are the keys on the piano or the right place to push on the piano or the right place to stick .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the letters in the title of the letters is only when you can see the language .
so for least , you need to use music for at least as well as the spoken language .
then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passive , or you can start to speak to the musical spring .
the work of the <unk> starts as much as the <unk> .
when you first chose to play a piece of it , because you &apos;re excited about it , you know , you &apos;re going to <unk> about the emergence of composition .
you collect information from the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thoughts from composers himself .
you study the works that he has written before and after .
you put it on .
the <unk> , writing .
what did he feel like ?
how were the circumstances of the circumstances and politics ?
all i &apos;m interested in .
you &apos;re sitting in those days by looking at contemporary images , looking at contemporary paintings or reading literature .
however , in the world , you know , as a interpreter , you have a vast democratic knowledge of the composers that you play more often than you can , and it &apos;s going to be easier to feel like it &apos;s in <unk> and feeling .
the composer is increasingly becoming a boyfriend with which you live together .
his concern is to write the piece of play , increasingly , more and more and more to my personal cause , playing it .
well , there &apos;s all other notes as well as a record of the credit for composers , but a framework for , turn , i now turn this framework to the order to make sense of it again and to <unk> .
and i say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> what these sounds might have .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they might mean for him today .
every note , every phrase takes a sense of meaning , because i feel it feels because i personally support it from my own now .
it has to get me in here , and now i can &apos;t be able to convince my audience here , that i can &apos;t convince my audience .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , that i &apos;ve worked for as long as i was in advance , and i &apos;ve got a new <unk> .
as you meet a happy new day , again , in the same rituals of life , they get breakfast with the same rituals of life , they get breakfast , and i &apos;ll keep the same piece over again .
i have become more than a day , the seasons , my pulse is going to slow down at night , when the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer the sound that the sound goes back than home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience , consciously , unconscious .
and all of that influenced me , and all of this affects my experience with the composition .
all right , well , if i &apos;m standing on a stage with a <unk> onstage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea inside , and again , that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make this sense of music , and they have experienced the audience , as the audience communicate .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;m never going to play so much , like that moment .
i can &apos;t play that today like 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to know more life than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> on my palette to the emotions and emotions and emotions as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have new <unk> .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> <unk> with my beloved old teachers <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and a famous professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great luck , very early on , with 13 years old , and so i &apos;ve been to meet myself in my classes .
i was 17 at the time when i was in his class , once again , the last four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
that &apos;s a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
he <unk> and he said , &quot; so ?
it has to be the <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was about 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but there are no major memories .
i play today the piece every few years , and i &apos;ve always changed it for me , although not a single note changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of that from a very different country . <unk> has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but with different <unk> light , at <unk> light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , just as they looked at him right now .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
i &apos;ve also been older in the <unk> than the chopin wrote in the past .
he &apos;s lived in only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to look back to the notes , even though i mean you can memorize them .
to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to have something like spoken for spoken word for spoken language .
in fact , the <unk> is so much that you learn the notes .
you learn to learn how to read just a word .
you learn to find sound to the notes on the instrument .
and then when all the finger and the right time , like it &apos;s in the notes , they come out of sounds like music .
when it happens , students get the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not going to be talked about the interpretation in the <unk> .
all right , there &apos;s a <unk> on the front , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s all here .
but even if you translate these samples , it still remains some technical technical .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget about a little <unk> .
namely , to make music on the instrument that are going to do their musical and feel before present .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn to sing , because the parents don &apos;t have <unk> , it won &apos;t do .
it &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and idea of the music to have it , then about another possibility , so about an instrument , to make sound .
people who never sang , have never been immediately with the body of my body , as it is to make a sound .
he &apos;s a phrase from his own breath .
the instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to the singing our hands and feet .
so , the sequel to the piano in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the tune from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> now with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to have more or more of music when it gets bored .
no more necessary to whistle or singing a <unk> .
each of its music is going to be <unk> by the outside with music with music all the time .
surely , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
and the question i did , can you &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they &apos;re not able to learn , or learn how to make these little vocal chords that the vocal chords , the vocal chords , are used right .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re training .
or c , because you have them <unk> that they are <unk> .
so , i wonder how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or a <unk> , how do you get it beautiful ?
or d , you may have no music , and therefore , no way to do it .
now , what i &apos;d regret is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can do it even more <unk> .
well , you know , there &apos;s no need to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , well , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there i &apos;m saying , but sure enough , you can tell if it &apos;s not you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it tells you , i don &apos;t know if i tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to stop classical music , because they don &apos;t have an instrument .
listen to it and tell you whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is to you <unk> or sweet .
say what you feel .
over time , they also get to <unk> , and they want to make more relaxed differences there , or <unk> even <unk> differences .
why do i challenge my audience now that i don &apos;t want to listen to ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to be there .
a piece that you never look at has no force whatsoever .
the food that was eaten by a cook or a chef <unk> cook , has got to be eaten , not only looking or looking at recipes or <unk> of the exchange .
so please listen to if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where the adults are actively doing , or at least active music is a kid who is a child growing up , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask for the color of your flower ?
can you also play me in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of having a blue flower now , a blue flower now .
and this sounds quite different than before .
and that was the very first beginning of a very very very powerful word expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that is originally written in a hundred , <unk> or even six hundred years ago ?
now the instruments of instruments .
there was no piano in the middle of the day as an instrument .
it was not invented yet .
i think that bach would have been enthusiastic , if he had the <unk> opportunities of today today .
i can see the <unk> that bach would have had to be on the stream on modern wing , which is a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s also from beethoven knows that he heard more than beethoven &apos;s deaf .
today a modern orchestra is a modern orchestra situation , which has been rejected at the time of a orchestra at the time .
that &apos;s why the composers depend on us to <unk> the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> , which is just in the spirit of mind .
and also what they would think about today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m doing today , because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were you <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives the drive .
if i come to my little v , <unk> <unk> , and next to me , this feeling goes on .
i &apos;ll take a little through your head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need , &apos; n big ?
that &apos;s what she loses for the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to do that , i have to do a little car ?
and then immediately , i think it &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to make such uncomfortable feelings as envy enough to disappear .
you can try and do that with words like revenge or <unk> or things .
i want to tell you something about this mechanism today , or what you &apos;re doing is what you &apos;re doing with this mechanism .
the mechanism is from lying .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say no one on the purpose of a wall .
and then <unk> stones so that he &apos;s <unk> them .
in such a lie , you see the liars themselves not believe what he says .
it &apos;s very easy to check out the way that he &apos;s in mind .
he doesn &apos;t just fake them and themselves .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is going to do with it themselves .
they need these lie to get a <unk> to <unk> a <unk> .
they can make them less easy , yes , <unk> or also to collapse .
they need time .
that time is an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once has a woman <unk> .
this woman has complained afterwards , the portrait would not look similar .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be more similar .
in this place , and if you laugh , you know how important this lie is , and how much time you need to know something about what artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to the lie .
the artist shares something with them , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when they just look in the mirror .
the artist divides them in a portrait of what they &apos;re only familiar with when they &apos;re going to look at this piece of art and again .
and then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not be similar to you , and it will always be more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in art , in the <unk> , in the mythology , in the mythology , it appeared .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked into the mirror every morning and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in all of the land ?
one day this mirrors , yes , there is a <unk> .
and behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true inform , also the mirror cannot lie , from that true climate .
but we just should be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell a woman to say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand , which is what we see under <unk> <unk> , over again .
we need these lie , and we &apos;re going to have the deception we can &apos;t live in .
we &apos;re not just in art , in the <unk> , but also in the science industry , in science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s story of <unk> .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of people .
that the human ancestor should and , yes , there was at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles wrote .
the man is supposed to be by the monkey <unk> or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent people all <unk> .
why do we prevent people from something that will know if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without those <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t <unk> these things .
we don &apos;t need to prevent people from things , especially if they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly that mechanism comes out of this mechanism and how the traces of the tracks that it leaves to something different than this great image of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife has told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
a <unk> student .
she loves him especially because he &apos;s a propensity to <unk> .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you know , when you &apos;re <unk> in that place , you &apos;re not true . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , always , a human in a moral approach , because using a human being , we should be trying to replace it with the <unk> while we &apos;re going to replace it as well .
you know , and then you get the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they feel that the real truth of the truth .
this is a little <unk> , which is not interested in the <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there are no clubs where we can look at where we learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second time , the fire department .
he signed up .
and <unk> , you also say , you don &apos;t want to put the teacher out somewhere and you &apos;re excited when the fire goes off afterwards .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we are in charge of putting the dangers that others can do when they just get fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this <unk> on the <unk> that <unk> knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
this is then just the words that we are in the language of the politically correct word <unk> and again .
in fact , we know something else about the case .
but we know when we &apos;re saying that , social relationships are very delicate .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , things like to be in a society that should work .
so i want to give you a question of what we found in my institute .
after which logic , these self-deception , the willingness to , one other reality , than the <unk> that we know in the unconscious know that it &apos;s valid .
so , here i want to give you two , maybe three .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of them , and some of them don &apos;t value at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something of intellectual , telling about leibniz .
and you think of the soul , you know , somehow in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , it &apos;s called the latin <unk> , the <unk> .
and then if this <unk> <unk> about the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , which can only live , yes , with soul .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s to get from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that should be present for our lives .
and if you have these assumption , you understand the logic , you know , with the logic , we can make our world better through a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> process .
you know , you &apos;re still familiar with school .
this is now a <unk> that describes the logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you have logic , but also the willingness to lie .
which is to lie that you can just be wrong this logic .
in this case , three sentences come before .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly highlighted him .
so , a third sentence is instantly in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the saying , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who is dead , and can &apos;t be a <unk> .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech , the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re correct .
and i can tell you everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make statements about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell testimony what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul .
these things are correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness is immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s based on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and what it does as if it was the opposite of the first sentence and <unk> .
because actually we have to prove it , whether it &apos;s the soul or there .
but with this logic , it &apos;s just that two sentences are correct that two sentences are correct , and a third of the <unk> that looks like this , and we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it was impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue to continue these things .
in the present , we have a whole modern example , which is constantly filling up the <unk> .
so , you have to have another <unk> topic , a <unk> of philosophy , your life .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the <unk> century .
there was an scholars that named johannes <unk> and after that is named johannes <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> natural nature .
this is not the soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you put the exact same in the middle between two <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know where a guy &apos;s supposed to first go .
so he &apos;s standing right in the middle .
so the <unk> is introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> forces solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
it &apos;s just when you bring another example , so if you &apos;re going to make a glowing a leopard , it doesn &apos;t need reason , and it doesn &apos;t take anything .
it &apos;s automatically the right thing to do .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of pushed up in nature , it &apos;s going to be driven by the bigger pile that you have right now , and then you have the sense that it has to be a free will .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> here at <unk> , then i remember the <unk> in brain .
there &apos;s a scholars that is called wolf <unk> , and he says , sometimes , the wolf <unk> <unk> says there is no <unk> .
now we can get back to the second sentence and say , the wolf is <unk> right , then he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re going to read about every day in the daily newspaper , you can find that in this third sentence .
and this looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have <unk> , can &apos;t be used for his actions and claims for the responsibility , and that &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you have to prove it to happen , whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first set of ever <unk> the first sentence in the world to take granted the opposite set of evidence .
and now you can just do anything if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , the courage to make a lie .
practice this , for example , if you meet a human and then you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and , please use german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little bit politically politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
you know , you &apos;re going to be able to find one that you have , for granted , that you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while it &apos;s busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there is no <unk> .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled .
because he has led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t touch themselves .
because in fact , this person isn &apos;t really interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in this to be <unk> in front of the need to prove that there is <unk> .
so , in the kind of history of <unk> , you see the brilliance of the lie .
and once again , if you have a chance to feel like this <unk> in other people , they do it because they &apos;re going to be other happy , if they don &apos;t remember it in the way they remember .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to ask <unk> if i could mention it .
it &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and asked me if i asked if i want to give a talk here and give me my idea .
i have to tell you , you know , it was <unk> , it fell hard to my idea .
and i may but i think i &apos;m trying to introduce you to .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum whole , very many of ideas .
and then i &apos;ve got it to berlin <unk> for berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> at the time that was called <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> today .
because a good engineer , it either has a great engineer or <unk> .
but it &apos;s kind of <unk> like n <unk> , which kind of a hundred watts of blood square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was an crazy <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m grateful to the <unk> that he has <unk> back again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because everything left there was no one left .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
it was just that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> , where they were feeling evil .
the place of <unk> , but it was <unk> , and has wind and solar power , and i started in the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yeah , a lot of what i was told today , because many , many , many , many beautiful expressions were that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years 11 years into the collective .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and i came up with <unk> <unk> , and then we have become <unk> , and then i became <unk> of the company <unk> of one of the world &apos;s greatest <unk> in the world .
and i brought a project i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how you come to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started talking with a relatively <unk> story , where you could just ask a memory of the memory , now .
on this island , this is the island <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people .
they have an renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
and i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they &apos;re always saying why ?
we have 20 percent in germany already .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , it was <unk> , the first contacts with the island , is just calculating times .
as big as big as it has to be a battery , so you have an island for 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system everywhere looks like this everywhere .
by the way , a year , by the way , a year is to <unk> electric performance in the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to happen is it &apos;s <unk> , because you don &apos;t need permission .
it &apos;s fast .
you put a box like this .
and then it looks like this .
in that run , three of them are always waited , and two are always waited .
well , this is the end of the load .
we &apos;ve got very accurate data .
and the <unk> or whatever it is , or whatever it is , is typically a <unk> system or a system , which is just in small quantities here .
our goal was to say it &apos;s okay .
the <unk> is going to be <unk> and the wind , controlling the burden of so that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the <unk> .
that means , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can start over the whole net .
of course , they can only be managed by , of course , in some ways here .
no one has done that in the world .
so that &apos;s the little style of that , so you can also serve in your car <unk> over a little bit .
people always ask me , what do you do because in <unk> ?
it &apos;s already going .
but if you want to get several of these <unk> <unk> , and you want to build a web , it becomes extremely complicated .
it will be a power station , which is then , hydrogen , methane , methane , power to gas or <unk> , that will be .
they &apos;re going to have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then did a whole bunch of simulations .
these were the very first calculation , six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the <unk> , when the <unk> five percent is rising .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would all be done ?
negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only at five people to build a new society back at that time .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green system , is the green system .
that our system has a <unk> , and it &apos;s because we &apos;re still 20 percent of <unk> , and also a <unk> on the other stuff .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island has done , which is really amazing .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall hall in berlin shown in which we can sort of build the electrical relationship of the island in the scale .
that means we were looking for finding the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> , and then became the japanese one .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of performance , and it can bring six hours to bring this power , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of have <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
over here we can simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the wire , to sort of mapping the <unk> on the web .
and you can see this whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see this again , we &apos;ll see the <unk> , here again , the <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since then was , since <unk> , the hall was finished , so until today , everything between the whole system of electronics was designed to develop software .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the theme and the web and everything .
you &apos;ve got to communicate to the battery , you &apos;ve got to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty of the topic that you &apos;re in on this island today is that it &apos;s all going to be <unk> on problems that we will get , if we want to increase renewables .
so this whole discussion , what is going to be back and forth at the moment is going to go back to the island , like to go back to the island of <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
and then <unk> opens up .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start around on the island of expanding <unk> , <unk> , because we can load the load .
that means that if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can do that by &apos; n , you can <unk> , you know , you can do that , you know , the percentage of <unk> , but you will never give in memory .
and that &apos;s the obvious n there .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what you &apos;re going to do .
when we shut up the <unk> , you just don &apos;t have these spinning mass that kind of <unk> on the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just composed of all rotating masses of power , where always the wave all over the wave around europe is <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look in this web , you see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ll start a few <unk> <unk> , then again , a little bit of <unk> steam in , and then again , we &apos;re going back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly <unk> .
if you take that somewhere , it &apos;s a long time ago .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have it , these spinning mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> with this big battery two milliseconds .
so , you see , the enormous one , you know , is there .
and the message is , well , we have to give up these rotating masses , if we &apos;re sort of giving our goals to 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to achieve that at all .
then we have to tear down our <unk> capacity on the web .
<unk> is simple , the power plant , to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a <unk> right now , right away from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not the point .
and we &apos;re just trying to figure out , you know , the capacity , the capacity , <unk> capacity , <unk> can be <unk> by the grid .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and to that purpose , people are always going to go and look at our <unk> <unk> , like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get there a little bit more .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had been in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never come out of it .
we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of it that we are in the next 30 years , the same capacity to store the same capacity for the world .
simple , so it will come .
there will be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years now that the scientists are looking at my site .
now , we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> now , and we &apos;ve got to get a german set of web now to <unk> .
this is going to happen in april the next april .
so , from that point you can see that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s only from this kind of <unk> to the idea of the picture , right ?
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussions , there &apos;s always been trying to do this <unk> , which is , you know , have a different web , which has failed to do with our <unk> .
the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent from any fossil , or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> somewhere in the world and become <unk> to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s in the sun and there &apos;s wind there , where they live .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of an <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m grateful that they said they &apos;ve said power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and this is what we &apos;re doing , and this is the talk of <unk> <unk> that you can get again a collective , and it &apos;s a little <unk> .
and well , i &apos;m going to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay really <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you .
now , as steve <unk> , <unk> of los angeles , one day of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who had just two strings in a violin , which had two strings .
<unk> row were juilliard , suffered a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row at the center of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , <unk> hall , <unk> hall .
he just had a demo of beethoven &apos;s <unk> and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking about a very <unk> and <unk> clay on yo-yo , hillary clinton and hillary clinton in the baseball world of <unk> , and that &apos;s what the dodgers would never do in the baseball world of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel <unk> for <unk> interest in me .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel has a medical treatment , because he was already stuck with electricity and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that had been treated his whole life .
and in the same way in the <unk> , nathaniel , when we were with our first classes in walt disney hall , he was starting to see this <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and he lost it .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison him in the sleep .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , a complete change .
it was like , as if the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction that was catalyst in my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , a calm curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle , he took his violin , and he started hearing some clips of <unk> some clips of <unk> , and then asked me to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , about beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he had not only had a <unk> knowledge of music , but it was connected to her also personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d otherwise know from my colleagues in <unk> of los angeles .
by making music in and talking about music , it was made out of this <unk> , <unk> man , who was still through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
nathaniel means music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with its imagination , is in something real <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
and this is why we &apos;re doing music : so that we &apos;re doing something that is inside of all of us , in the inner lens through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality that speech makes us all , and is inspired , inspired , inspired , and it unites us .
representing what nathaniel , which brought it back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought back to a family of musicians who understood his mind and realized him .
and i &apos;m going to play with nathaniel , no matter whether it &apos;s <unk> hall or <unk> hall , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit that i have stolen <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known in my life a lot of fish .
i only loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate kind of thing .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good taste <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was getting in <unk> after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could feel it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about months .
one day , the director called the company of the company , and i asked if i could tell you an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to fix this unimaginable problem for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have <unk> the ocean as we run bare forests .
it &apos;s hard to make the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
it &apos;s opposed to a lot of arguments . <unk> contaminated the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re tuna .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
so , that means 15 pounds of <unk> are required for a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company , trying to make it right .
i wanted them to be supported .
the day before the event , i called the leader of the pr for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
don &apos;t say , &quot; don &apos;t just have to be the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , as far out in the ocean that you can &apos;t eat the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out of our fish that are distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a whole of your own world .
these <unk> from <unk> to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what feeding ? &quot;
sustainable proteins , he said .
i said , &quot; great . &quot; i put on .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , to don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , say , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to have an opinion .
well , i <unk> with a bunch of people in the company . nobody could give me a <unk> response . until finally , with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are the sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , you know , feathers , skin , <unk> , waste <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
we might think of two percent .
&quot; well , this is about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , do what &apos;s sustainable , chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish fell after that conversation .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know , the better you know , the better you know your fish , you know more .
i got it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had talked about this fish for a long time .
she &apos;s in a sense called <unk> .
he came up with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can &apos;t .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . it &apos;s actually called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> , which were basically the wetlands .
they did that by using the country .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they pulled out water from the land and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically , not economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what many birds are .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water in reverse .
they have literally <unk> the lever .
instead of using the water , they use the channels to the water , to <unk> water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a <unk> hectares -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and <unk> , and his company , the ecological destruction completely opposite .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and these density , lush , lush .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we struggled through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> <unk> to my knees .
this is a rare one , <unk> <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of <unk> .
and here , here he sees a pattern of <unk> that &apos;s reminiscent of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> <unk> has spent the greatest part of his career in the <unk> national park .
and i asked him how he has become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then it goes and falls down into more <unk> of birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i cut it off . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it make your fish so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the algae , the relationships , that is incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that there &apos;s such a rich system that the fish you would eat in the wild .
the split biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there is no food .
the one farm that is not feeding their animals ?
in the moment , it was a director of a <unk> program .
and we <unk> around the corner and we offered the most stunning sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , literally a separation in carpet &apos;s so far .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well , last year , on this area of 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest , and one of the most important private <unk> <unk> in europe has become .
i said , &quot; well , do you know a <unk> <unk> isn &apos;t the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is an <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the <unk> .
so the <unk> the <unk> the system .
okay , let &apos;s rethink it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , that <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city 60 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly up 240 to the farm .
and every night they go 240 kilometers .
they can do that because they &apos;re the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly it 240 miles to the farm and then fly it 240 kilometers back to the farm ?
do you for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was quoted at the whitney of houston whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i almost don &apos;t take dinner with it .
and yet , when i tried to stay in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t tasted at all <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure as if you took a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something to go into the body .
she &apos;s developed over the course of evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t supply their fish . a farm which measures their success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it <unk> huge , because the water that flows through that farm comes from the river in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things out of those rivers that are these days , and these are chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it was fought by the system , and that leaves the water , it &apos;s clean , as it <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it clean the water .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> it in the atlantic ocean .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this story , as romantic , as romantic as romantic .
you might say , you &apos;re a recipe for the future good , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
now what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food that food is actually good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re a lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> ; we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that the things that the future of good food is somebody on and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than to feed .
a billion people are going to live today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
feed crop crops , <unk> <unk> , <unk> chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time we have been , &quot; if we feed more people , how terrible can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the gift . it was the <unk> of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , an industry in <unk> , an enterprise , the quickly <unk> capital that allows that production to do this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not due to <unk> <unk> , but based on <unk> resources .
not through <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through <unk> , but through fresh water , not through <unk> and nets , it &apos;s not through the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that every community empower themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never made a really good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in two billion years <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
and businesses who are not just in the worlds , businesses , the building rather than <unk> , businesses , who are <unk> , instead of just a lot of relationships , but experts in relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts .
and when i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef when i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because when this future is good , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical <unk> plant .
the program i used here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter away after a certain cause of cancer .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it come .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> , people are most active and they &apos;re on the <unk> over here .
we can step out one step further and organize the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we went on and went to age , we say 40 years or younger years ago , we see accidents that should be concerned about people .
and who sees <unk> , that &apos;s true of men .
so you can see that the point of information and data in this way is very <unk> in a living way .
and if we can do this for raw data , why don &apos;t we do it for any content ?
now what we have here are the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your field .
with <unk> , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a single year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue , and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong fan , so i click this out where the <unk> armstrong will mention , and i &apos;m mentioned .
now , if i &apos;d like to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i &apos;m looking at the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you search for this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to do or not just <unk> .
you do something that is actually slightly different .
it &apos;s something between us , and we think it &apos;s changing the way that information can be used .
so i want to go a little bit further , which is a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken each <unk> , and we cut them on a little summary .
that &apos;s the summary of a short overall view of it , a symbol of the area .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the hit <unk> .
but even in that <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
so immediately , we get a sense of the themes that are on the hit wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote for the government .
well , after i voted the government , i know that the <unk> which is most of the time , which is most of the year .
this is really important because this is an insight that are not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to see if you take a step back and look at this .
i can look at some of this summaries in time , and then i can go into the issue of time <unk> people , and we can see all the together .
now , if i look at these individuals , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some of them get less , come from the economy . here is my boss .
and interestingly , a bono prize is also a <unk> prize .
so we can jump back and look at all the ted prize .
you see , it &apos;s surfing on the web for first time as if it &apos;s a network , not just by side , but more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can look at websites with this -- and we &apos;re going to take these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step back and get directly to some specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why , because it &apos;s just because you &apos;re just looking at points of websites in this way that can look at the whole level of websites in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular frame .
here &apos;s the only demonstration that i &apos;ve given up to here .
and i can kind of have everything i looked at now , again , <unk> .
and , if i &apos;m going to take a step back and look at everything , i can <unk> to my <unk> , and here , i went to <unk> for <unk> , or here , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and from here , i can get into the site and get to them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that keeps used back , and every time it makes a big picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
if we can do this , it &apos;s going to be these past <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving information into information , we can get out of it .
and if we know that , maybe we can even pull off .
that &apos;s what i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion science fiction .
in my high school i went to school with the bus , every day one hour .
and my nose would always put in a book , a book , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and most of the time , my mind <unk> into other worlds , insect predators .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to figure out the world and trying to explore the limits on the way .
and my love to reflect fiction fiction in my neighborhood , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world showed us that we could never have before .
well , this probably has <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could draw .
and since it was neither video games nor video games with <unk> , the whole imagery had to be in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at all . if we were to read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them onto our canvas .
my response to that was this drawing and drawing by aliens , aliens , <unk> worlds , robots , and all of this stuff .
in the <unk> , i was caught in the teacher &apos;s time when i was hidden , in the field of textbook .
the creativity had to get out .
and something interesting happened , because what struck me about jacques <unk> shows , was the thought that was a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i certainly would never do that in a space with a spaceship , and that seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on the earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of what i &apos;ve been imagined on , when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided .
the only problem with this is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t catch up at all .
i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , pointing to the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i just got two years later on my face when we moved to california .
since then , over the 40 years , that &apos;s been <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , how we really hardly imagined .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know the limits , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
for today , i seem the deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is , the same intensity as ever .
so when i was an adult , it was the <unk> .
that seemed the best way to get my inner ability to unite , to talk to my need images , to unite .
as a child , i painted all the time comic books and this .
so , films of the way were to bring pictures and stories together . this fit .
of course , the stories i &apos;ve been to <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; aliens . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to combine my <unk> for the <unk> and connect with the filmmaking .
so , basically my two passions are .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , back .
and the first thing that came out was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever seen in a movie .
it was a film that didn &apos;t make money , exactly , he just played his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience was <unk> out around the world like <unk> from the magic .
according to arthur clarke , the law is <unk> technology and magic to be different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that i found an incredibly exciting .
and i was like , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what it has to be involved in <unk> . &quot;
so we went , &quot; <unk> , &quot; so on , so far further .
and together with <unk> created this guy from liquid metal , the success hanging from the effect was going to come .
and it worked . again , we had created a magical thing , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit of time with the movie already .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity for creativity .
so , i started a company , with my good friend <unk> <unk> , who was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called &quot; digitally <unk> . &quot;
so the basic idea of this company was that the phase of analog processes with visual processing , etc . , etc .
and then we did it , and we took a competitive advantage for a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we were doing in the company , too slowly .
but the bar pushed a lot back , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
so i shifted that and made this other movie about the big ship .
i &apos;ve been selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . it was an <unk> scale , a passionate movie .
but i really wanted to go to the real train of titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the movie .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we go up to the <unk> . we go up to the <unk> . we &apos;re the real <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to the point that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality six months later in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and my real titanic are looking through the surface of the north pole .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that blew my mind .
and the amount of preparation that has been enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and everything .
and i noticed how much of these <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up to those capsule , you &apos;re floating in these dark , <unk> environment , where you &apos;re not able to get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
and anyway , in the process of curiosity and science , it was . it was all . it was . it was a curiosity .
and it was an experience that hollywood can &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
so that &apos;s really me <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
so after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood for a little while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to <unk> , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took small robots that we had built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look at <unk> and the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one has ever been the inside of the <unk> exploration . you didn &apos;t have any tools to do it . so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that are pretty similar , and i know that once you &apos;ve played the band of the titanic .
and i &apos;m going to fly through a little <unk> walk through the <unk> of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s actually just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically present in the titanic of the titanic .
and the set was quite a copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize that you can use such <unk> <unk> , and so you can use your own consciousness in the vehicle to that different shape of existence .
it was really incredibly profound deeply profound .
and perhaps a little view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
after that expeditions , we began what we saw at the bottom , really appreciate learning , for example , these <unk> , where we saw this amazing amazing animals . that &apos;s sort of alien , but here &apos;s the world .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the ground with sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees c , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in <unk> , which was again , the <unk> from my childhood .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out on the end , that i went out to the deep sea .
we were living rooms , but actually , in fact , science <unk> , in particular , <unk> .
so , the circle , between my existence , as a <unk> , then as a child , and the implementation of the reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got to be a director , you know , a leader or something .
i don &apos;t have a lot of leadership before i get there .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> films we don &apos;t get any money .
we just play the <unk> . we &apos;re not a host of fame .
everybody thinks i was between the titanic and the avatar , and i would have a <unk> on a towel on a beach on a beach .
i &apos;ve all made these movies , these flags , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , sometimes we have been in a row for three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you can have , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
there is a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i got back back to my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to make the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re being respected , and in return , that you deserve .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain . we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .
very exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we have been for a four and a half years of a four and a half years .
so it changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who said that we were going to have these <unk> really well <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
to me , it was more like a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get from all of that ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think first of all , i think , is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning for your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmakers , they say , &quot; give me a advice to me like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; not even one .
it &apos;s all for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet on yourself , not to yourself . &quot;
nasa has this idea of failing , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and in studying failure , failure has to be an alternative , because there will be a <unk> .
not an important endeavor called innovation , the without risk .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you the way . failure is an alternative , fear but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and that might surprise you , because my favorite of the foundation is mostly to enable vaccines and seeds to do the things that we create and provide the poorest two billion to enable the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate change are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing . it &apos;s too much rain , and it rain too much rain . things are going to change the way their fragile environment can &apos;t be .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the <unk> is very important for them .
in fact , if you can reduce only by one thing , the price of energy would be far more effective at the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like a time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the industrial revolution , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a strong case in the <unk> , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air <unk> , and therefore we can make modern materials .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but when we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price -- let &apos;s make a new barrier , and we put this barrier to co2 .
co2 heats the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are , there are some of those ideas , but not very many .
and there are certainly in ambiguity of how bad things are going to be , but they &apos;re extremely bad !
i &apos;ve been asking the <unk> multiple times , &quot; we really have to get down to zero ?
isn &apos;t that good enough or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes further .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 meter of high truck , which is under one <unk> bridge , and then you can kind of <unk> it underneath .
this is going to have to be a zero .
well , we <unk> a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people of poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create change that can cut it down to zero .
it has gone up now .
just different economic changes , and we have to be able to use <unk> increase in reducing , and we have to get a reduction in reducing .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of individuals and think about how we get to zero .
probably one needs to get a very close number of numbers .
now that &apos;s the basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today &apos;s life billions .
and it goes on nine billion <unk> on 9 billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> could be , we can cut this 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a slope by 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes everything , the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> , which means to make those services almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s a great thing going up .
so , here we see a very fundamental service . there is light at home , so you can see the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally there good news .
we have something that is not rising .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other ways of <unk> , through new ways of <unk> , there are many services in their energy by 90 percent .
in other services , like manufacturing from <unk> , 105 flights : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is the amount of improvement in improvement .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction in three or a factor even six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;re now at 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion pounds , and that &apos;s simply not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit .
and the question is , if you can get to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every one of these <unk> is co2 , these days , co2 , and <unk> .
so , what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the wonders , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to a lot of this miracle .
you don &apos;t usually have a date , you need a miracle to a certain date .
it &apos;s usually wrong , and some of them are coming , not .
but in this case , we have to get <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i actually deliver that ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that the idea of people &apos;s vision ?
i remembered last year , when i got mosquitoes , and somehow people liked it .
the idea was really , really , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
for energy , this is one .
so i decided that this would let my <unk> work on the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i told me you don &apos;t bite you . you &apos;re not going to bite the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they don &apos;t get a lot of them .
we need to get solutions , either one or multiple <unk> , and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many ways people are looking for after it , i really only see five demands .
i &apos;ve left out , <unk> , fusion , fusion and biofuels left out .
let &apos;s first take fossil fuels to burning fossil fuels of either coal or gas .
who will make sure ?
who can do something like that , literally , many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough part .
next , <unk> .
then , what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not big , it &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and they should be soluble to work .
the last three of the five ones i &apos;ve been summarized .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called in renewables .
and they have -- although it &apos;s great that they need no fuel -- they have a couple of drawbacks .
one is the energy density that these technologies create dramatically less than electricity .
these are <unk> , you talk from a lot , a thousand times more than a normal power station .
and then these sources of <unk> are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , but it doesn &apos;t seem all the day , but the wind doesn &apos;t seem all the time .
and so you have to , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way that you don &apos;t have to have .
so there are big <unk> here . there are challenges in the transmission , if we say , for example , that the energy source outside of the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 , than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over 20 percent of the rest of it .
if you want to rely on 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where are we supposed to go , what is the right approach ?
the manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are many companies working on it . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people who already have commitment .
bill gross big companies , among other words , has been a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies who do great things , and what i &apos;m trying to do is to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company , which is maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time , so it &apos;s no big surprise that some of the good concepts did .
the <unk> means that instead of one part of the <unk> , which one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s waste as a <unk> .
instead of breaking off your head , you burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
the uranium is going to be incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; traveling the wave of reactor . &quot;
that solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a place in kentucky .
this is the 99 percent , which is the 99 percent , which is <unk> , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that drives the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are still many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should be measuring our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , as well as a lot of agriculture , and hopefully get <unk> and cement .
so , in order to achieve that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , is completely completely shift .
the other grade says , whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is great important .
this is going to be a key feature .
if we go back from there , how should we look at the 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to reduce reduction in the way , the less we &apos;re going to use , the less <unk> , and also the temperature .
we have to pursue these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure this thing , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> the hot air crash . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discussed , because we need a support of all the pages .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
this is a wish .
a very active wish , that we invent this technology .
this has the largest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to use for more research .
when countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk these <unk> , and they &apos;d be shocked by the ridiculous small funds that these innovative approaches are being spent .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; d a thing that creates <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to get dialogue and full of full , and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first of all , you can give us an idea of scale ?
the tricky step is the building of the first <unk> , to find more billion , the <unk> , and the place of actually building .
when the first thing is , when it &apos;s done , it &apos;s all clear , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is so different as we know it .
in order to understand this , which means to build deep up into the floor , like a vertical column nuclear engineer , this consumed carbon <unk> and then starts working on the bottom , and goes on to the bottom ?
<unk> : right . now , today , you have to <unk> the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people , so there &apos;s a lot of people who can go wrong . this thing is not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think about a column -- you think it &apos;s buried without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
one of the things that offers a solution to the junk .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit there -- there are much less garbage with this method -- then you take him and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in the waste that &apos;s already in these <unk> or <unk> , and that &apos;s our <unk> .
so what these reactors have was a problem of what we put in our fill , and it &apos;s going to dramatically reduce it during the process .
but as you &apos;ve talked about , with different people in the world .
where is the greatest interest in doing this ?
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have a little bit of something .
this is a variant of something that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster , and some countries have built these , so everyone who has done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , &quot; well , and your chances are something really on your life ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years to apply .
that &apos;s basically the <unk> that we have to look at the <unk> that we have to do .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could that easy .
and fortunately today , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , and we need hundreds of companies , the way their approaches work , they can work for it for the pilot &apos;s team .
and it would be best if it could create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
<unk> of great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
that would have been it without the <unk> , but it &apos;s more important .
in the nuclear sector , other innovative companies are .
you know , we don &apos;t know whose work is not as good as these , but there is the modular method , which is another approach .
there is a liquid <unk> that seems a little difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what it seems about us .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> to try and keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : when you come to this situation , it &apos;s like that you ate too much , and you have a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is based on various techniques to delay warming to <unk> , to <unk> us 20 or 30 years for 30 years .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you know , not only do you work in insurance because you &apos;re going to eat a little bit , you &apos;re going to eat that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince them ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there &apos;s negative impacts to do with the clouds that are moving things out ?
there are very , very few things that you can even say , by which there is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for that much later .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about us .
<unk> : well , the actual spending on research -- we say that the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t be suffering .
you get to <unk> , and you can disagree with any sensible people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that , for me , most of the food waste is happening .
because , you know , you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funded just the learning curve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much more expensive .
if the <unk> that you get , you can only get the rich .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much as our energy without changing the lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinking about .
his new <unk> now is , &quot; why don &apos;t we <unk> ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s now <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little support is going to be .
bill , i believe i &apos;m talking to almost all of the people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is to be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter <unk> was a <unk> company called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . <unk> , the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about 20 spaghetti tape , about three feet , about a meter .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work , because it &apos;s driving very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into an <unk> .
it was a huge success .
most usually , most people do about the task itself .
they talk about it , what they &apos;re going to look like , they &apos;re <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they &apos;re <unk> .
they spend most of their time in the <unk> <unk> structures constantly .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put them carefully on the top , step one step back , and you get a step back .
but then , what &apos;s going on , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; becomes a &quot; <unk> &quot; , because the weight of the <unk> causes the <unk> that the whole thing will be .
there are a number of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> than others , and under the worst are fresh water <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really confused by the form .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and under the best , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they produce not only the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , why is that ? why ? what ? what about that ?
and peter talks : &quot; none of the children invest in the ceo of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were being trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what &apos;s <unk> different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes always <unk> with the marshmallow at the top , so that they <unk> the possibility of fixing prototypes .
<unk> can recognize this kind of collaboration as a nucleus <unk> .
and with every trial , the children is immediate feedback , which works not .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but look at how different teams are doing .
the average for most people lies on about <unk> , <unk> half of them , but not much more , <unk> are better than adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
three feet , the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to making stable structures .
ceo are something about average . but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator on the team , you will significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and this team , the regulate , and at work , is to watch the performance of the team significantly better .
specialized skills and <unk> and the combination to success .
if you have 10 teams that have the typical approach , you get about six who have stable structures .
i tried now something .
and i thought , we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> in the same way .
so i offered a $ <unk> cost software to the winners .
what happened to this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone could have built high construction , he would have carried home the price .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high pressure has a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
this is the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the end .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;ll help digital tools and processes to help get teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is it helps to identify them hidden .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a shared experience , and a common language , or a stance , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in you can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of the world as people like the system <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually the construction of a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses into the task , and we think we &apos;re using our thinking optimal , how our emotions and what do we do in the challenge .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that needs to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we have a machine that we have here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room must .
and you can go into the past , you can &apos;t go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i ask myself what you would choose , because i often ask my friends in last time , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or america or america .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m in a sense that you somehow are drawn to the <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s not going to go back on this planet , and go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that it ever gave on this planet , no matter what scale you can do : health , wealth , mobility , declining declining .
there was never time before that .
my <unk> died all of them when they were 60 .
my grandparents encouraged this number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born today in new delhi &apos;s life as long as the richest man in the world is 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox , smallpox , billions of people killed on this planet .
they have formed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever been done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . pop !
in the rich world , diseases that exist , the millions of us just have threatened by one generation , hardly even .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billion people , are the successes of the scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method , looking at things , look , if it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s changing , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve mentioned a lot of other problems , and they &apos;ve mentioned a lot of other things .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in the world go to bed hungry .
this number goes up , and it goes up very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> land , rainforests , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , soon , and if we don &apos;t from this chaos of chaos , we go away .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which is billions of people who are feeding , not to rape .
i think we can power this world that doesn &apos;t destroy them at the same time .
i think this really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that i wake up at night . we have scientific progress still needed so badly .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it , and we &apos;ve never been able to do it today .
people <unk> out in their faith , and that is so much that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth gets it .
and listen , everybody has a right to his mind ; even a right , even a matter of progress .
but do you know where you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at <unk> , to <unk> resistance , which is at the end of the most effective activity in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always want to do , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve got an article written about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they thought that molecules would be a certain kind of <unk> , a random kind of <unk> <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept making .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but that article was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found out .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> were not <unk> me at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so confusion ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we have to get at one point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we talk about it , with little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have faith in the institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , weapons , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed they were always right . so they &apos;re skeptical .
ask , ask you , desire the evidence , desire for evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s : if you have to get this evidence , you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell you that we are now in an epidemic of fear now , as i &apos;ve never seen them , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with them , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine combined .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that was true .
lots of studies have been done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we think we see , what we think is , what we think we &apos;re really feeling real .
we don &apos;t think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
one of the people in the world : the united states is one of the only countries in the world who are falling down the <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well i understand that . i do that .
because anybody got <unk> here ?
has one single in the audience in the audience at <unk> ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
well , in this country at all , but in adulthood , in the last year .
these are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can in denial about it , and people like jenny <unk> around , and the fear of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can &apos;t connect , because they can &apos;t connect , correlation .
they don &apos;t seem to be the same thing that these things seem the same , but almost never the same .
and this is something that we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed with a few other people a <unk> .
he can save more life a year in the developing world in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , this is good , apart from the fact that paul <unk> and vaccines about vaccines , and it says that people should just stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so , paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks to a public <unk> , he can &apos;t talk <unk> <unk> .
he gets phone calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where children are going to school to school .
and why ? because paul has done vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that vaccines are essential .
take them on , return the diseases , all the terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we have <unk> in this country now .
and this is getting worse , and pretty soon , children will die back , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of <unk> .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t get her kid against <unk> <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe i don &apos;t know , maybe tomorrow &apos;s one morning in lagos , and just going to los angeles , right now , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to come up with one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to put it in lies . we love that .
did you all put your vitamins in this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to get on the <unk> .
i know you &apos;ve done that , because half the americans are doing it every day .
you take this stuff , and you take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that it &apos;s useless .
that &apos;s the data all the time .
they make their urine . they &apos;re never going to do it .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should be . our health care system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us and <unk> ourselves that can afford it .
so we walk out before , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re going to walk into the arms of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that &apos;s really serious because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of that -- <unk> , fraud , <unk> , <unk> , that i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people go and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people what you want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which is saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography care , &quot; or any <unk> who want his patients to treat <unk> .
if you &apos;re on that path , where believe and magic evidence , it will replace you , you &apos;re going to get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 to 400,000 people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that they can stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the <unk> epidemic , where we &apos;re in , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically engineered food and the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every branch , every branch of <unk> , every branch of people changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last eleven years .
and some of them didn &apos;t work and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve got rid of what worked out .
now we can make it more specific . and of course , we can do it , but we can do something about vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , and the stuff can help to extend million people .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we are <unk> <unk> .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my response on all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , the science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow the science to do , because we &apos;re afraid to do a <unk> , and it holds millions of people out of the flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this is the investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ?
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that &apos;s a half billion billion people .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve starvation , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about the ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , 10,000 food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> ; it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time of understanding what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing that , we &apos;re guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after that incredibly funny entertainment conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go back into this ridiculous time machine and in the future ? &quot;
definitely . that &apos;s what i want to do .
in the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to lead that conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up into the machine time and go into the future we will be happy to have done that .
i know that we can , and as far as the world needs now , it &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
a deception will true to something , because somebody who perceives it .
and so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s is in every <unk> for children .
i myself have learned him from <unk> <unk> magic <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain .
so , look what happens .
the knife they can study , my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to get the knife just in my <unk> .
i push my sleeves back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeves goes out and out of him , i &apos;ll just get my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that doesn &apos;t happen at any time , as long as i can here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife is held held by my bare physical <unk> .
it &apos;s actually so <unk> in its place that i can shake it , without even the knife .
nothing moves in my sleeves or come out , no <unk> . and you can examine everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often do young children who are really interested in magic to magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
many of you probably know this trick in the room .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m my wrist <unk> to make sure nothing in my sleeves , or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i <unk> my wrist is that the secret is the actual secret of illusion .
because at the moment , where i &apos;m my hand of them , they &apos;re going to look at them in the back of the back , so this finger here , my <unk> , simply from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back sitting there .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m <unk> , the finger changes its position .
but this is actually not what &apos;s happening here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s <unk> , but not through the surface of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , that &apos;s where it &apos;s there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by getting me <unk> , that &apos;s where the fingers <unk> over again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that trick you with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
one year ago , i read a study that really blew me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
and this is what it turned out : if you offer a placebo goal in a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you &apos;re going to give a <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and these blue dye , and a letter to it is actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of the pharmaceutical facilities -- they &apos;re just <unk> .
but a <unk> pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out .
it turns out that it &apos;s not all about it .
when you take <unk> , it &apos;s more effective than any pills .
a colored capsule on the end of a <unk> , and the other red one is better than a white capsule .
the dose is also playing a role .
a pill twice the day is not as good pills -- i can &apos;t remember the <unk> statistics -- i &apos;m sorry now . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is .
... that &apos;s a role in play .
and the form plays a role .
and if you want to make the ultimate ultimate , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you inject patients .
this creates a very powerful picture . that &apos;s a lot more than a white pill .
this chart is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another one of them , if we have a projection .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well like a capsule that works not as well as the <unk> .
and none of it really has a really <unk> property . it &apos;s only our belief that we can make a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously an illusion , and let &apos;s look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to the needle when it comes to the point .
this is an 18 inches long time . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of <unk> .
this is really my meat , it &apos;s not <unk> special <unk> of meat .
this is my skin . this is not a effect of hollywood .
and i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and i &apos;m going to go through through the other side .
if you make fun , if you cut away -- i have a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman &apos;s almost <unk> .
so , i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re going to <unk> very quickly , you look away for the next 30 seconds . or , you know , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it , you can also see , but if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make this crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin , and on the other side .
now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had the same thing called the <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> itself , even the skin , just for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t really seen this . &quot;
the people in the <unk> come in now .
so let me show you from that nearby .
this is my skin . this is not a effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
sorry . if you make fun , look away , look away , don &apos;t look .
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , it &apos;s .
so i would normally take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with purpose , from a deception , something real , i &apos;m going to just leave you there , and i &apos;m going to go on the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple more or a few days .
i hope you &apos;re very happy . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people out of the books that have been published with happiness in the last five years , and they were released after about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in the interest in researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these <unk> of work , there are several cognitive areas that are going to be almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly going to act like this .
this is the terms of terms of terms of your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just so confused as a result of everyone else .
the first one is a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
it turns out that word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there is a certain significance that we could narrow it down , but in the big and large , this is something we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a phrase from experience and memory : basically it &apos;s made between happy in his life and happy to be happy with his life or happiness with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the imagination of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the miserable fact that we can &apos;t think about the fact that we can &apos;t think about the situation that affects its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and then he added , really , really very emotional , which has the entire experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruins were the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
it didn &apos;t matter because he was <unk> with a reminder ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what it really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and think about other people in the sense of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , capable of experiencing the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m here ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units of units , the <unk> self , and the <unk> self , and the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that starts really with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts instantly .
we &apos;re not just telling stories , if we do it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we need to keep in our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there is an old study .
these are real patients in a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s no painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who of them have suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has been suffering more clearly . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients think that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a much worse person had <unk> to the <unk> than the patient has been b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is a very clear one .
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the worse that it was worse where the pain was at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to ask , and much later , &quot; how did the whole thing be overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse than a b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the perspective of self , b has clearly had an awful time .
that will lead that the patient is suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
what &apos;s a story about ?
and this is true for the stories that make us memory , and it &apos;s also for the stories that we invent .
so what a story <unk> is , is <unk> , significant moments and end .
and end is very , very important and very , very important in this case .
now , the <unk> self lives his life continuously .
it &apos;s got moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
most of them are completely ignored by themselves .
and yet , you somehow get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of the <unk> of our life .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we consume while we are in this world .
and as we use it , it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that &apos;s holding the <unk> self for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal of time .
from the point of view itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week , it &apos;s as good as the first week , the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> self , this is not a <unk> vacation , hardly better at vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , this is actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> itself from a <unk> self . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remembering and to tell stories .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose to do between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as an infinite memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> self , and you can think of yourself as a <unk> self as one , which is sort of the <unk> itself by experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we do this very often , that &apos;s a very common case , which is called , largely , in the services of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a bit of justify , i think .
i mean , how do we <unk> from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the <unk> itself .
and i &apos;ve probably had my memories journey on this <unk> journey , and i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve ever open the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and it &apos;s only a half an hour .
there seems to be a disagreement .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of <unk> all their images , and you get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
why we choose the <unk> that we choose to do with a choice between the two of themselves .
well , the two species of themselves , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are these moments in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a rather complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness even over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy that person is to think about your life .
very different term .
and everyone who doesn &apos;t get these terms to screw up the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m one of a lot of the researchers about well-being that we &apos;ve made a lot of things that these happiness have made of happiness .
the distinction between happiness in the <unk> itself and the happiness itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a survey , where more than half a million people have been asking questions about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there are other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about happiness in the last few years .
and the main lesson we learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and it teaches them not a lot of how happy he lives , how happy he lives and the other .
just to give you a sense of correlation that has about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about its scale ?
well , you would know something about his scale , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has his life as eight , you have a lot of uncertainty about it , how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so correlation here is little .
we know something about what the happiness performance is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly what we like to spend time with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but it &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re trying to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;ll see very different things at the end of the self .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we should really &apos;t think about happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason that we &apos;re not understanding about happiness is that we &apos;re not focusing on the same thing when we think about life , and when we actually think about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are , you don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think of that question , you know , people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people could get to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are going to california , to become happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is , you &apos;re going to think , you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , how awful the weather was in ohio . and you &apos;re feeling that you &apos;re having the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we spoke to a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting result that there was a pretty interesting result , which came out of this <unk> survey .
is this something that you can share with you , because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result , which we found in the <unk> survey , is a number we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness for itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 dollars , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under one income of 600,000 dollars per income .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , they become poorer .
that &apos;s a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
now , what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t buy a <unk> , but that lack of money to give money to an clearly <unk> , and we can do this misery very , very clearly .
in the spirit of self , the <unk> self , getting another story .
you make the more money you make the happier .
this is not for emotions .
but danny , the whole american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take these <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to look like everything we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians would say that the country generally would take a sense of how to take it seriously and do politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition of recognition in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k , you &apos;re just happening in other countries .
people are , acknowledge , that they should think of happiness , when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study <unk> , or have to study it , so we need to study this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how they think and whether they think about the <unk> themselves , or whether they think about it themselves .
this will affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you get to measure the <unk> of the population .
that will be , i think , next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this issue is , or should at least be the most exciting political debate over the next few years .
thank you for behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m thriving , ok , i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing this for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in the reality of the reality , as it is in <unk> .
i &apos;ve got a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time playing is bigger and more <unk> .
right now we spend three billion hours a week per week .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; well , that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the center for the future is , according to the opposite future .
three billion hours a week , aren &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase it dramatically .
i calculated that the required time of 21 billion hours just <unk> a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite why i believe that games are so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of <unk> phil .
he wanted to capture the feelings in games . so he did a camera on the players .
this is one of the classical expressions in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may be clear of a <unk> in this picture .
you &apos;re probably looking at this sense of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , a <unk> in a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some <unk> , you see the <unk> eyes , and the mouths are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the verge called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive that they didn &apos;t know before , that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked , that they &apos;re actually capable of something like this . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player is just a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to do in millions of faces all over the world , if we have the barriers of the next century in attack on the edge of the next century , face the face of the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult issues .
i call it as &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am in life , i &apos;m doing bad things .
this is a graffiti in my former berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis in my thesis for why we &apos;re in play better than in real life .
this is a problem that has a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not so good at reality in play .
and i don &apos;t mean only less successful , even though that belongs .
we &apos;re doing more in <unk> . i mean , i &apos;m good at doing something about motivation , inspired to work together .
and in reality , if we run out of failure , we often feel different , we &apos;re often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , they don &apos;t play it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in play , thinking , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we put these feelings out of play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal setting to the communal environment problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed a couple of things that the epic wins in <unk> will make .
well , first of all , if you &apos;re in one of these <unk> , especially world of warcraft , there are lots of different characters who are willing to be willing to give you a <unk> mission , and that immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at your current level , right ?
so they can do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to work together , but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re <unk> . there &apos;s always a thing to target .
and there are lots of lots of employees .
so where you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them work to work to work their epic mission .
this is what we don &apos;t have in real life , that feeling that there was plenty of employees in a <unk> .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have heard of &quot; level a <unk> , &quot; and &quot; + 1 starch &quot; belongs , or &quot; + 1 . &quot;
this constant feedback is not true in true life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + 1 , and + a crazy idea -- + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in true life .
so , the problem of warcraft like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , any time on the edge of a <unk> , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so today , all the world of <unk> has spent <unk> million years to solve virtual problems to solve virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see in the context of this , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go upright .
so , the first <unk> .
ok , so if we &apos;re going to talk about how much time we &apos;re currently playing with , it &apos;s just meaning when you &apos;re in the order of the human development of the human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this all the time to play this whole time on playing , actually the change what we are as human beings .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe i am .
take a look at this interesting statistic , which was recently published by a researcher carnegie university : the average young man today in a country with strong <unk> spends to the 21st of 12 hours with <unk> to the 21st of 12 .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours is the exact <unk> that they spend in school , from the fifth class to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> here , on the young people as well , which means to be a good player , as everything else , what they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours of how to do a single subject to the 21st of year , we &apos;re going to do this .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players &apos; players right ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to put potential in there before .
so many people are now having a lot of time in the world that at least one hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary to be in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are remarkably good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> process is designed to save energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so that players can play online in the whole world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total of a billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it &apos;s doing for us to master these games .
here &apos;s the 4 things that i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do some immediately , to do a barrier , with the belief that we have hope to succeed .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth it , and it &apos;s worth it , and it &apos;s the same .
players are not sitting around .
player , masters social social nets are .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we may have people who have played out of them , even if they defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to someone playing a game .
we trust that someone has spent time with us , that the rules will be <unk> that we have the same goal , and we have to stay with the <unk> .
so this enables the <unk> to grow up by bonds , trust and each .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week play , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happy to work hard to work than if we relax or not doing anything .
we know that as human beings , we work as human beings , when we get hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard , when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it to become a part of awe of the missions .
so here &apos;s a <unk> to put that on the right thing . you know , all wikipedia , the world &apos;s greatest <unk> .
the second largest <unk> in the world , almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve done more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other <unk> in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is that you believe , you can change virtual worlds , but not the real stuff .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to fix .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much energy , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not seen a witness in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is from an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not as i do -- i develop games , i &apos;m a bit <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense , actually , because players can do more in <unk> than in real life .
they can actually make stronger social bonds than in the real life , they get more feedback and rewards in games as in the real life .
so he says , it &apos;s completely logical right that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
there were these fantastic <unk> <unk> .
and that was kind of the first of the people we developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek <unk> , you may be familiar with this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to games , games were <unk> , more precise , in the kingdom of <unk> during a famine .
and there was such a great famine that decided that the king of <unk> came to a crazy idea .
people were fighting . people fighting .
it was an extreme situation . it was an extreme solution .
so , they invented a national strategy called <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . one day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , and they would be so fascinating and we were with <unk> , <unk> productivity , surrounded productivity , that they had nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived so 18 years by using a day , and they were playing on a day .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape suffering from the suffering of the physical world .
we put games in order to get rid of everything in the real world , which is not really useful in life , and we get what we need to do .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not getting great better . so the king , the king , last <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a <unk> , and the best people were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they were leaving <unk> , and they were looking for a new home . they just had so many people to survive , and they were looking at the rest of the time that they were able to thrive .
this sounds like crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which is later the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , scientists recently came to the notion that the crazy story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> organization that took nearly 20 years of what the famine might explain .
so this might be voices .
you may actually have saved your people through playing with you 18 years of playing in games for 18 years , and then these <unk> had been learned so much about that , and that &apos;s how much saved civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been warcraft in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been warcraft for 16 years .
i claim we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization on the search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should have been <unk> that half of us a day spend an hour playing with play , until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to be asking , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been working on in the last few years in the institute .
we have this flag in palo alto , in palo alto , like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to think about the best possible outcome , and then empower people to make this sense of reality .
we set ourselves <unk> , and giving people the opportunities to reach them .
so i &apos;m going to show you three games that i designed to try to make , to try and get people <unk> to their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you &apos;ve got to overcome a <unk> .
we have tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 . and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , you &apos;re going to get the oil . &quot;
this is one fascinating adventure to be on .
and find out how they would survive , most of our players have these <unk> habits .
so we &apos;ve got to play a bigger game for the next <unk> game , and we have a bigger goal .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the future for the future .
now , the calculation is the calculation of a <unk> , that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you know , the call on player , at a little bit of a call on the <unk> .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s the <unk> . they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together they can save the world .
8,000 players playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 very creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re <unk> .
and the last game we get on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
so if you finish the game , you get from the world bank response , the award for &quot; social <unk> , law 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa and store them , social redesign .
we have a comic book to do . we have a comic book to be understood , <unk> , sustainability , vision and imagination .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people around the world , particularly in <unk> that benefit to us , to save their own social design , to save the world .
i &apos;ll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have not saved the world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit close nets , <unk> , and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play major games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you will design with me that design play and play .
if i &apos;m going to go into the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things : that we can create any <unk> future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so , i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what a couple of months ago in writing a article in wired magazine .
i always got my <unk> at the end of the day , but i was working with the record of the text already , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never done in my life in my life .
i &apos;ll read you the point .
<unk> : healthy , powerful , powerful .
of course , it was a <unk> , old <unk> . i was just thinking that the output must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i first started the elementary school and started to form my sense of self outside my family and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use <unk> .
if i was in a way seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me to perceive as a person who is living in any a sense in any a sense in any way that i have experienced .
so i immediately said to myself the <unk> of 2009 , and expecting me to be a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she isn &apos;t much better .
in particular , the last two words in &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> is a big force , because what you can do is also <unk> .
so , what do we really want to do -- one disabled person or a powerful people ?
you can do a human being <unk> as a child , just <unk> , <unk> and giving you beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful to open doors ?
a person who opened for my doors was my pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name was , as you can think , most americans could not be correct , and so he was called dr. p. <unk> .
and dr. p. <unk> were always flying very colorful , and was for work with kids just like created .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
and imagine , i &apos;ve actually tried to negotiate with dr. p. <unk> , and so try to stop doing these practice , <unk> without success .
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to ask myself today , like his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls , and i could imagine myself , as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and <unk> person .
this is just an example of a lot of how adults can make the imagination a child .
but as a result of <unk> examples , our language gives us no room to see anything , which we would all wish to do : it allows every single one to be able to see themselves as a healthy people .
our language <unk> the societal change in the social change behind a technological change .
so perhaps it shows this technological change , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every human being on society is able to have a very powerful and very powerful , and human ability to adapt our largest one .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re designed by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i claim that that is good .
<unk> are not a obstacle , which we need to get <unk> to live with our lives .
<unk> are just among our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact of it , not the impact of the <unk> of a human being .
there are <unk> in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and every person &apos;s going to do it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we &apos;re clear of it or not , but how we &apos;re clear .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people who we love to preserve , but they &apos;re ready to get ready for sure .
and we don &apos;t really like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things out of the fact that the medical fact to be <unk> , and to other social problems about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only thing that i had to put in it is that i had to put apart , that the world is constantly saying , she can describe me with that definitions .
maybe the current concept , which is just to look at what &apos;s in a broken , and how we fix the repair , and how we fix it , for every single greater disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t overcome a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities and acknowledge it , we create in addition to the natural fight that you might have to lead to another disease .
we have a human being , who has value for our society .
so we have to focus on the <unk> and focus on all the human possibilities .
what is most important is that between the perception of our flaws and our great <unk> , there is a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to do these <unk> times or denial , we should not try to avoid them , nor should we try to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see it in the <unk> opportunities .
it might be more like , clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome the fact that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome it , but we &apos;re open to it , you know , you &apos;re a hug , you know , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> as something natural , <unk> and useful to see us as their presence as a presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday , darwin , and when he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin , in my mind , has pointed out very true in human character .
i would like to use it , not the most powerful of its way , and also not the <unk> of its way , but the way that can adapt to the best changes .
it &apos;s generated conflicts .
not just from darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability to survive and survive , from the struggle of human mind , is determined by conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of human beings .
and maybe we only know what timber is about , if we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the point of <unk> , a perceptions of that -- a sense of our own force .
we can give us something like this .
we can give a new meaning to a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are a change where we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s be honest -- who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s the usual question . the typical one . but not the normal person , and would you want to know the person , grey person , if they really were ?
i think rather not .
<unk> , we found out that we have always been useful in the members of our society : useful to be useful and a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals were about 60,000 years ago , and people with heavy habits have carried out with severe physical injuries , and that might happen , because the experience of knowledge was valuable in these people .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were considered something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee &apos;s mullins . &quot;
and i look around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i started getting them out of the belly .
oh , so that .
and then , of course , it did it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i knew only from my mother &apos;s narratives on this day because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> my mom was on vacation , so my parents knew the guy who brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born with no <unk> , and my feet had been looking at them , and i was just a few toes on this and a few toes of the other foot , the <unk> , the bad news .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how crucial that is to be human for the quality of life .
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with it , are two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of time when you asked me about the age of 15 , whether i would have my prostheses against legs and bones from flesh and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i wanted to be normal at that time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and maybe that transformation could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened my doors rather than to meet me , or to me an idea .
see , it really requires a human being , showing you how they can demonstrate their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own , inner forces -- -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you have a very good teacher , and you have a very good teacher .
they teach them to open doors .
the actual meaning of the <unk> is &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something to produce something that has potential to be .
again , what the potential is we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k , they were transformed in <unk> . they were transformed in <unk> .
they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are <unk> by notes .
and a student <unk> <unk> , getting a better teachers , and so on .
they &apos;ve been talking about a <unk> period with a &quot; good &quot; note with a &quot; good &quot; note . it was told them , they were <unk> , they were very smart , they were really <unk> .
and of course , there &apos;s a heart , of course , that the local <unk> was told , they &apos;re just enough .
and then it was the three months after the three months .
but only the ones that were still in school -- except by students that had <unk> school .
at this point , the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed .
they were just told that are the <unk> and that are the students enough with the note enough , and they have taught them something and treated them .
the only disability is a broken mind a broken mind , a mind broken , has no hope more . he finds no more <unk> , <unk> <unk> and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we create it , the human mind continues to hope to hope , and other people and other people around it are beautiful , curious and <unk> , and then we make our forces really positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can actually create a new reality and create new <unk> .
come dance with me . thank you very much .
how would they want to be better than they are right now ?
so suppose i said that by a few changes of genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more specific and faster .
or do you want to be more powerful , stronger , more force .
would you like to be more attractive and confident ?
how longer is it to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who has always been over to more creativity .
which one would you like most ?
which one would you like to have , if you could only one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
so a few . probably , about how many people there are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the majority , i love as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world .
is this just fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here on the ted conference , but today , i want to give you a second point of a doctor .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also an <unk> in the russian <unk> church , once wrote an essay with the &quot; nothing in biology in biology . &quot;
but when you accept biological evolution , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for other people or is it too ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some came and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote to share with the other parts of the tree , but in fact , the most fundamental mechanisms are our cells quite equal .
is that clear that we can use it and the mechanisms of a shared bacteria <unk> to produce the protein of the human brain , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it is in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think about that when antonio damasio says , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only be without a endeavor .
it &apos;s a really easier way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> , forced power .
but , you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they help <unk> nutrients . they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life is just a little bit of a <unk> , the animal kingdom , as a single stroke , and the human life , a small <unk> .
that &apos;s us .
now , this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , d ace of them .
now , when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was intrigued by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i was in love with something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information is going to be led into both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms began to change things .
sexual reproduction is the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is <unk> , the rest of the body <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of our body in evolution is in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , who read in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door open .
front of him is a beautiful <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george , i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to the conclusion as a doctor , that i was a goal of thinking differently than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to restore health to a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about reducing the genome from the genome to the next generation , adaptation , and survival generation .
so , from an evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s , you know , how <unk> rockets are designed to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage to the orbit to the ocean .
i think we would all think of the mood that <unk> of all the compassion to be understood when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i &apos;m not going to die by going . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
in the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are present to the <unk> , and by the hot steam , if fish were there , it would be a vacuum of fish for a consequence , and they were able to do a <unk> environment for themselves .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that , first of all , is that we &apos;ve been taking a lot of genes , managed to get a lot of genes that would have been <unk> .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so that we &apos;ve been able to adapt it to us that they adapt to us exactly as well as we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and <unk> and <unk> us so much that they can &apos;t say much longer that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that there &apos;s a evolution of traditional way to be , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of the evolution slow down , but it &apos;s been <unk> .
and so far the isolation is going to be <unk> as a species distance , it will insulation isolation and change the environment in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> option , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development is not just natural , but led by us as <unk> in the choices we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
let &apos;s see the reality that people are doing today , in certain cultures , making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men as women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so , think about that if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of their child , but also make genetic adaptations , to cause the diseases and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to eradicate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease to eliminate risk for risk ?
wouldn &apos;t they want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , this kind of changes will be possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and a half a thousand and a half .
it &apos;s not going to be available for a long time to get the reality that it will give you a 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin can generate in bacteria can make viruses that can not only be , but also to the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in walking with vaccine for influenza on the cells in the cell cells .
can you imagine a good thing that &apos;s from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and it will be much more possible in the future .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> or the <unk> <unk> , to make your children live a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating diabetes , remove the risk of cancer ?
who does not want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease can also allow us to say goodbye , <unk> , <unk> -- that better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place that we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution for <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires the rule 100,000 years , and we can compress it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are your grandchildren who have to deal with your grandchildren , or your grandchildren .
do we use these decisions a society that is better , which is better , which is more successful ?
or are we going to choose selectively attributes , which we want to do for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society <unk> and <unk> , or more powerful , or more <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to address .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom of the wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to do to make these decisions ?
in good like in the evil , and early than you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or one another , the <unk> process helps to get up and go back .
at berkeley , we call these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something you can put in in the morning , and it gives you extra strength and it will increase your pace , for example , to keep your balance .
this is indeed the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- it &apos;s so , and connect to the universe and others are out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers on average , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it is the request for you to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we were going to think that we would embrace this challenge , and we created a <unk> that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds above <unk> terrain , for many hours .
its flexible design enables you to get deep down to <unk> and <unk> <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and get my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re so far , we &apos;re going to introduce this device to this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now , let &apos;s take a look at our attention to the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m very passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s about one percent of all .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about a very young person with spinal cord injury in the height of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- the fate was hit , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it also goes to the aging population , the number of multiplied .
and so pretty much the option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or about other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , since 500 years , to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the field of mobility .
now , let me introduce you to now , which is amanda <unk> <unk> , which was 19 years ago , 19 years ago , who has been the result that she couldn &apos;t run over 19 years since and so far .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wears our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals that are <unk> on our <unk> , who is on their backs .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as their <unk> , which they move forward to this fairly <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and i was in <unk> when a <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never get again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every most hopeful hope .
so <unk> technologies have been going to come back to me since <unk> , to climb , to rock and drive the hands with the hands .
but nothing was invented me back until now , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for us to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the whole potential here to change life , to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m scared of <unk> of a non-profit called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t have the poverty of poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a volunteer a volunteer fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to get <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers at the <unk> , so i had quite good opportunities in it .
but it was still a race against the other <unk> to reach the people <unk> and to find out what would be our tasks .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the <unk> that certainly had one of the worst days of your life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> and <unk> under a screen in the <unk> rain while home in flames .
the other volunteers that came out of this was -- let &apos;s call him moral luther luther -- to get the <unk> king of the first , and was asked to save the dog of the house of <unk> .
the dog ! i was <unk> out .
there was any lawyer or a <unk> , which is now for the rest of his life to tell people that he went to a <unk> house to save a living , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go home .
you have to go up to the top of the fire , to the fire , and have to have a pair of shoes . &quot;
i promise it .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down where i put my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put up our size up to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , a couple of weeks later , the <unk> letter was a letter <unk> in the <unk> , where they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> .
one of all the measures of kindness has provided a pair of shoes .
and both in my profession at robin hood , as well as in my <unk> as a volunteer , i witnessed generosity and kindness in the vast scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i see myself in this room , and you can see people who either have been able to achieve success , or on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in any life until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give it to you .
operate in a park in the neighborhood , rooms in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the life of a man , but every day gives us the ability to change one .
so they &apos;re going to go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the <unk> of mankind .
a place where women do the <unk> lead to sex hi &apos; hello , and the game is determined -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their mating .
this is the wild bonobos in the middle of congo .
bonobos are with chimpanzees our next living living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which was about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are familiar with their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the human evolution of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
whereas chimpanzees from large , fear <unk> were run by <unk> females .
they really come up with something , because that leads to a <unk> society in the deadly violence haven &apos;t been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known as the primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re very difficult observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent competition for decades and almost so many of life has asked how much world war has been .
it &apos;s not surprising that those destruction are at risk survival to bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> lead to the <unk> that you couldn &apos;t even fill up a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there &apos;s no reason to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know as a &quot; love instead of war , &quot; <unk> , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules and social engagement .
i &apos;m not saying this is the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobo &apos;s life made out of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love playing your life .
play is not just <unk> .
and for us , it &apos;s essential to the attachment of the relationships of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we &apos;re learning confidence and the rules of the game .
play with creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity from diversity -- diversity in interactions , diversity in behaviors , diversity in connections .
and when you watch bonobos at play , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique recordings of the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origins of this : &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
it &apos;s just that i think it &apos;s more likely to be , right .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both for bonobos as well as people .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of whom are quiet , <unk> , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the wonder .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s <unk> with water .
and i think just as you play , sometimes we can count , and we <unk> boundaries of our inner and deep worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us do research and interact , and the unexpected scales that we form is the real grain of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos us into our past and present .
but it also is a secret to our future for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges in increasing challenges , more creativity and levels of cooperation .
the secret is the key to these skills of these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we must play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , for bonobos and people alone , life isn &apos;t the teeth and the claws alone .
just if it &apos;s barely appropriate , it may be at the <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re dealing with creativity and <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 , at the same moment , at the same moment , every <unk> baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> , a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine it , because , if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
think about it just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case that you &apos;re in a case , the <unk> <unk> <unk> is carrying on the x chromosome .
and in the other case , the <unk> is one x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hats .
well , under a hat &apos;s hat , i am the anatomy of the anatomy .
i studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that &apos;s the case , the animal bodies -- the animal , animal bodies -- how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve carried on my work in my work is the activist , as <unk> -- or , as i say , as a <unk> lawyer -- of people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> the social norms in the question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who have not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of things that are not living in the male or female standards .
in one case , you might have somebody with a <unk> <unk> gene , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> leaves the <unk> gene that we &apos;re all going to have , <unk> .
and so the testicles are on the <unk> stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a consequence , the body evolves more to the typical female trend .
if the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes time to get it to puberty and grow her breasts and grow their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period until someone comes to this .
and they &apos;re going to make some tests and find that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , are testicles in the fact that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , have something called a <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> hormones , which are the <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably would have the typical -- most women -- most women like me are actually talking about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that has more <unk> than a woman who was born with testicles , and a woman who was born with testicles .
gender are really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can you be spread all the bandwidth .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> was so active that they &apos;ve created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male gives his <unk> male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody saw anything .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because it turned out to be <unk> that doctors find that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , which is something called <unk> , which is called <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
gender can occur in many different ways .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- was it <unk> or <unk> twins , was <unk> -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because it would be adapted for their physical health care .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why we &apos;re doing many different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
our system typically is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain kind of anatomical value with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that we have to be a woman &apos;s name is called female identity ; one black person is thought to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this terrible idea .
and when we faced a body with a body that &apos;s actually a little bit of a matter of us , that &apos;s very different to us .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about makers .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people are born in a body .
where i had experienced most of the big excitement was the most exciting year , <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender have been asked in berlin .
a lot of journalists were calling me the question , &quot; what &apos;ll be the test of what tells us , whether it &apos;s <unk> <unk> female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s this test .
we now know that gender complicated is a little bit that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a line between the male and a female and a female and a female and <unk> and female and female and <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which is a much more complicated than what we see as a lot of more complicated .
in our art , we got into all kinds of <unk> areas .
so , for example , we run into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we only differ from a lot of <unk> ?
as we keep our science forward , we continue to move increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we must recognize that the <unk> categories that we have probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world is in our culture today , in the united states today , the fighting and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about where the point to people is that it &apos;s a different right than the kind of kind of kind of <unk> life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as not as publicly as in medicine as in medicine .
our ancestors had never been so hard to struggle with the question of when someone dead died .
and you have someone to miss a feather under the nose , and when she moved , they haven &apos;t yet buried it yet .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve been buried .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we can take people <unk> organs and put them in other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re <unk> to the fight with the really difficult question when someone dead , and that &apos;s where we have a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have these simple categories like earlier .
now , you might think that the whole thing would work out of categories like me was really happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit it .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , <unk> .
and it makes me struggle in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i first <unk> that i &apos;m a big fan of the <unk> .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think that they were so powerful and strong , and so radical , what they were doing , and so on , in what they all made me care about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> happened with the <unk> .
the <unk> were from my view of the original <unk> activists , which is why .
what they <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , that was radical and beautiful for us , and for 200 years .
as you all remember , our <unk> <unk> the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy built on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the ruler of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who have political power had to do that have to have that political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather to the father and so on .
and the <unk> meadows and meadows and so they were using a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all the people have been created at the same time .
they <unk> the field , and decided that <unk> , the <unk> , the differences , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they were doing that part because they were part of a <unk> system in the process of two things .
the democracy grew up , but the same time grew up the science .
if you look at the story of the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , <unk> , meadows things like a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and god of nature .
you &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
you talk from nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they gave us a concept of <unk> commonalities .
and so they &apos;ve prepared a really wonderful way of the future .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
and women <unk> that .
the next thing came the successful civil rights movement , where we people like <unk> <unk> , who went on about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people more different colors who are <unk> related to anatomical differences , again , successful color .
we see the same thing at the <unk> table .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the common ways , we need to start to ask in the question , why we need to maintain certain <unk> .
now , mind , i want to keep in particular , <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a fish .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be the right to sex , or to get married to sex .
so there are some anatomic <unk> that make sense of me , and that &apos;s what i think i think is .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is , and why we feel it &apos;s good .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , in 1979 , in 1979 exactly the same day .
imagine that one of them , maria , three months was born , so she was born on june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is going to be born , so he &apos;s born on one march in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months of <unk> was born , you get all kinds of rights before <unk> to have <unk> , the right to have sex , the right to drink .
heinrich must on all of these waiting , not because he actually has another biological biological , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other people in terms of their rights .
heinrich , you assume that he &apos;s a male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he is with <unk> -- because you assume that he &apos;s a male , he can now be moved in , about which maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
maria , however , can &apos;t be able to see the same thing in all states , and that &apos;s right to get married in all states .
heinrich can get married in every state , but maria can just marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways and <unk> .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science of anatomy is made in the anatomy that we have to make a point where we have to admit that democracy , which is the anatomy that &apos;s grounded in anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give science , but at the same time sometimes it feels like science itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; good , we need to pull a line , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people <unk> in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , at a point , that you decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and one woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people will not test for their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the history i started telling you about the <unk> .
if we &apos;re looking at one of the modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us in his &quot; i have a dream to talk .
he says , we shouldn &apos;t ask people to be &quot; your skin , but after the property of your character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do people do because of their <unk> ?
i want to make <unk> that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions than some <unk> that i know .
so how do we ask the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me , what if the content is something that would be something that would be something that would be done in the future -- through fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to this ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to worry about asking questions of democracy .
in our commitment to democracy , we &apos;ve done it really well , and i think we would make our things well in the future .
there are states that exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , which had some <unk> twins at <unk> them to separate them , partly to make a name .
and i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political asylum in consideration instead of one operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offering an incredible opportunity to allow people to allow people to be able to allow them to change the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to end , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or looked at , if we could have more involved .
and i want to say something to a feminist is radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are caused by different kinds of anatomy , <unk> if people will apply a <unk> .
for years , since years , i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average , -- not any , but on average -- tend to complex social relationships and the care of people within the group , very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my favorite people who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so it &apos;s still a feminist question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the <unk> question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about the stereotypes about gender cambodia , so in feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is to say that there might be something , on average , what makes us different from male brains that makes us different for <unk> social relationships and sound for the <unk> .
and maybe it &apos;s what we need to go to the future when we have to go through the anatomy -- less about the individual bodies , what matters more about relationships and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re people trying to make a more useful connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to take a different kind of opportunity to find a different kind of <unk> , crazy outfit , to photograph , and to email , too .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of influence on the environment , and also my wallet .
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique , and it &apos;s making my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i did for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone get with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
i brought seven pair of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week , anything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i made bet that i &apos;d like to bet everything i might wear , would find if i wanted to get to palm palm .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around at ted in your underwear -- that is , i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i &apos;m going to do , whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> of <unk> .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , has got me 55 cost , and it was the most expensive piece i carried in this whole week .
monday : it &apos;s a bit powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be <unk> , bad <unk> if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : so <unk> is being totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be able to try and adapt me to the same time .
just be , who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , it &apos;s not just going to be understood .
wednesday : give you your inner child .
sometimes people tell me what i would look like , as if i &apos;m going to watch it <unk> , or i remember her seven-year-old .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not going into something good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that in the inside and the outside is a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit for everything .
and finally , saturday is a unique one , unique to personal style is a great way to talk about one over the world to talk without saying a word .
it was always been proved to me and again , when this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to happen in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;m going to donate it all back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things to be <unk> , because it &apos;s just going to be the corner of another <unk> , <unk> , <unk> outfit , that just waiting for me to love a little bit of my heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something here to show you .
think about this as flying as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
some time ago , it was so that if you wanted to win a formula a race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver , and a good car .
and if the car and the drivers were good enough , they won the race .
this would be , in <unk> , call a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting about this is the <unk> start to appear in our lives .
our cities have been in the last few years with networks in the last few years and electronics .
they &apos;re going to become computers in free .
and as a computer in free , they start to respond to other ways , and they &apos;re being perceived and driven .
when we go to cities , this is actually a big deal .
by the way , i just want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the planet emissions up until 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big deal .
beyond the cities , all of this sense of view of the everyday life is <unk> .
this is from an exhibition , the paola stops for moma later on the year , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , begin to speak to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there is to be out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction that we humans have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
now , our environment , for the very first time , to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that sense .
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce to you is actually one of the first things we want to do .
it came from four and a half years ago .
the summer was a happy -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> won .
some of you will remember it , it was as a italy to france , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
won &apos;t win , italy .
now look at what happened in this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see , in the middle , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
this morning , before game .
you see up the timeline .
once afternoon , people here and they &apos;re making calls made and move .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call go on .
second <unk> . the end of normal play .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , at that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big big deal .
the next day , everybody went into the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of space <unk> , where , since the roman time , the roman time people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key thing at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city of today , in a way , and a way we couldn &apos;t do it .
another example , a different example of feeling : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well , today we know all about where our things are coming .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know little bit about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to pursue the garbage while he goes through the system .
so we started with a bunch of volunteers that we have , a little bit more than a year ago in seattle , having helped to highlight the things that they &apos;re going to take -- different kinds of things , as you can throw out -- things that you might throw away with .
and then we have the little chips that little brands , on the garbage tie , and start tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away , is not just going to go away somewhere else on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we were to show that human beings , then we can push change behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> has a nice tradition in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were going on in a <unk> <unk> was , imagine this tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves , they open up and close .
they &apos;re doing something like a <unk> with <unk> water .
if you fall down that <unk> , you can write yourself patterns , images , pictures , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to it , and you can open it up to this image as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it &apos;s got a very dear it .
and we got the assignment to design the <unk> building the <unk> .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and get them in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to reduce those syringes , you can even cut the roof down .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just like that , it &apos;s almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s going on what happens inside .
and here you see me , when i try to test sensors that open the water , you can &apos;t get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped .
but actually it was more fun at that night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that open up is going to open up to you , but a building that still breaks down and holes in the water , you had to jump to without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we do .
but reality is unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , which is the projections of water and the projections .
and this is what it brought to us about the following project i &apos;m showing you .
imagine if these <unk> could really start flying .
imagine if you could have small helicopter that flies through the air , and each of them with a little bit of <unk> light with a <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter in front of you as the one you saw earlier that you saw earlier .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in formation of two dimensions .
or <unk> , but in three dimensions , which changes what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of <unk> .
you can play with different ways .
imagine a screen could appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud from <unk> that you can come up with , and you can go through that , you can look at it from a lot of directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to form a <unk> v .
so if you zoom on on the lights , it looks like this . so how we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is being <unk> .
it could be every single impulse that has a impulse that comes from people &apos;s movements or something .
so i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the power <unk> in milan -- we took its movements in 3d as an impulse to the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s also a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can understand the entire movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all <unk> , you can play and gravity can play with color and gravity and <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a direct impulse to the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re doing for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so , the idea is , again , imagine that we put the people in to do something and to change the environment -- almost like what we call it , <unk> <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine if anybody can give a donation to a <unk> donation .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened last few years is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the digital forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow it can go to the challenges of asking us -- think about climate change or co2 -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually have the people to engage in things that they collectively do together .
the cloud is a cloud of <unk> , in the same way that a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s an intensely physical thing in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom of 2012 , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more , and it &apos;s as kind of connection to community .
so the things that the physical cloud in the sky is and something that you can go , like london , <unk> new <unk> .
you can go inside .
and one kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i was very important .
through my work i &apos;m trying to express that people are separated by nature , and everything is connected .
the first time i was nearly 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i did awe .
my heart sped off , i was <unk> , while i was trying to believe what was in front of me .
the <unk> <unk> around me nearly 60 feet from the water , and i was just amazed that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , a year .
<unk> are born as a calf or a calf from <unk> .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with a clear way of interacting with their surroundings .
some are <unk> and actually <unk> up to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t stand , and in a <unk> <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg iceberg , you think that you are isolated , separate and alone , just as we see humans often .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg melt , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
so , during the iceberg , he bursts <unk> drinking water , which feeds a lot of life .
i go to my photographs of these <unk> , as i would like to make portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious mind that they exist in these individual moments of this kind of thing , and never will exist .
it &apos;s not a death of death if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i <unk> is very young -- several thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the final images i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i have in greenland in greenland .
very rarely you will actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
so here it is .
on the left-hand side , you see a small boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and it &apos;s just like the iceberg of a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary to work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing that i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing on him .
i have a company that makes design and animation , so it is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and admire it .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to leave him with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t it -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
does anybody have seen the movie &apos; film and <unk> ?
so they communicate -- these are their fingers walking along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can this be ? &quot;
so i got a check , just a check out a check , and instead i made a check out that i had not the slightest idea of how i was supposed to be .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who does all that in it is not able to communicate it . &quot;
so i talked to a couple of months later on a conference .
i met these people of <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project any light on any surface , and then to draw on a <unk> surface that would only recognize the negative surface .
so they move around and do <unk> like this .
they say that all the things up there are going to be shown up there .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally , people actually do art .
but there &apos;s always a life cycle in your presentation .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached a couple of things .
first of all , we have the insurance insurance company , and actually , for <unk> , we have a device that he can communicate with , which is stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really funny -- i call it <unk> , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from the world -- literally , from all of the world &apos;s corners -- to us home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into the garage and the hacker and programmers and programmers have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that , and we &apos;re <unk> , and all the images on the walls were <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;re programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , and we have <unk> , you &apos;ve got a <unk> , and now we have a device that is freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can download the code free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free by limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital too .
everyone <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s a room of somebody else and this room .
there &apos;s all of these <unk> <unk> .
and after a year of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony for the first time , after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it &apos;s beyond his life support system .
we tend to <unk> his bed to the outside .
we set up a projection against a wall of the <unk> the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to deal with a lot of time in the parking lot , and we had to deal with ourselves as a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he sent us an email with the following : &quot; for the first time seven years , i &apos;ve done something .
i feel like i was getting underwater , and i finally got someone down to the bottom and up my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
it keeps us on the shelf and we keep going .
and we need to improve on that machine .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
and somebody who has potential to make a more powerful potential .
so , we &apos;re in the process of finding out how to do better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one made out of it .
it &apos;s all from our pockets .
so the pile was , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us , and then december , has we honored the <unk> , as one of the 50 <unk> inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april , when this april <unk> <unk> in the inner city from los angeles to give an exhibition in the city of los angeles .
and there &apos;s probably pretty much the toughest <unk> of the <unk> present -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these boys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , what i &apos;m thinking about is , if you see something that is impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all right here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , had never done anything with <unk> , but i &apos;ve just got a little bit of <unk> and amazing people with amazing people so that we could put together on the legs .
and that question should be each of you , and every single day , where do you make something done , it &apos;s going to have to do this . if not , now , when ? and then , if i don &apos;t , who ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m writing for kids , and probably america &apos;s most likely <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m always saying to people that i &apos;m not like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but no one has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is for usually something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you go to block and take it as revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle at the time was in high school in <unk> , ohio where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was <unk> every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by putting me the toilet in the bathroom .
did they <unk> .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had an thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from the middle of the night , <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad , we never know each other as adults have learned .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to come up with me . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , and we took them , and we took it to us , and we gave them to her family , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just when the woman who wanted me to know me as adults , it turned out to be a full <unk> , and was placed in my hands .
what happened was that the circle closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is , the death of a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved yours .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is a lot of mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he needs to take , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you &apos;re up to 1,000 meters .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine an engine of the engine that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds fear <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> .
so i saw them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan could .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
turn on it down .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i was able to see it in your eyes , and i was horror about it .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment it &apos;s all different .
while i later thought about it , one phrase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because when the wine wine , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to move more <unk> .
and this urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we got the george washington bridge , so pretty much to <unk> -- i thought , &quot; i thought , &quot; there &apos;s one thing that i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i <unk> to become better in everything , which i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i gave it to my ego .
and i <unk> the time that i &apos;m wasting for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to people .
and afterwards , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i haven &apos;t got a lot more to my wife with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be , right ? i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; <unk> , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , how you know it from a documentary .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , to die isn &apos;t terrifying .
almost like , we &apos;re going to prepare for our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really <unk> in an idea , which is that i just wishes one thing .
i just wish i could have my kids growing up .
for about a month after a month , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not much more intense talent ...
don &apos;t yet .
and i <unk> , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
i realized at the time when i joined the dots , it &apos;s all about being a great father .
everything else , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father .
i became the miracle of <unk> that day not to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , coming back and alive .
my call to all the people today , is : imagine , the same thing on your flight -- please not -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would they do to cut them down , because they think they would be there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for nuclear weapons development is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here are <unk> .
now , if we have to succeed , the systems of <unk> and the valves control , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it that is an effective vehicle at a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> building , which is used by a <unk> box , and then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> goes to the gray box , damage to the <unk> and iranian <unk> <unk> -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you about how we found that .
when we started to <unk> our research back six months ago , it was completely unknown to what the purpose of this <unk> was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what the <unk> part , the <unk> part , he made of all the <unk> <unk> of failures .
and it seemed to be a little <unk> , <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> , our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> and studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> things like a <unk> <unk> that our cheese didn &apos;t like -- <unk> it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made a sense of my eyes .
and after we experimented with different kinds of cheese cheese , it went to me that this is an <unk> attack .
all along a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active in the gray box around the gray box when one particular configuration was discovered , even if that special program was discovered , it &apos;s going to be on this goal .
and if not , then <unk> does nothing .
so , i really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , a $ <unk> power power plant , or an <unk> in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we have the <unk> code and found that he &apos;s <unk> in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were designed very high , of people who had obviously all <unk> information .
they knew all of bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
now , you know , you &apos;re probably the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more complicated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking here from -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you about how we were capable of becoming smart .
so what we were looking at as well , was <unk> <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we looked at <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring these real world into connection -- potential in the real world .
so we needed some theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or prove it .
so , to make these theories , let &apos;s talk to ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely in iran because most of the infections have been reported .
now , in this area there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically the <unk> nuclear power industry , and the <unk> nuclear power in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me get a list of all experts on <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and she <unk> her knowledge to compare what we found in the code , and what we found out in the code .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> in touch .
the rotor there is this moving part in the <unk> , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , then you &apos;re actually able to break the rotor rotor , and then even the <unk> to explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack actually was , it &apos;s slowly , and really , very easily -- to let you go to the trial , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to do it quickly .
and the great digital <unk> -- we got a look at a glimpse from where we were looking at very specific and <unk> .
so for example , the number one <unk> <unk> out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started with science literature <unk> , about how these <unk> were built in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re <unk> in the so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> .
so that &apos;s what makes sense .
and it was even better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 or <unk> .
and guess what ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , this fit perfectly well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we &apos;re looking at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results have been done by several weeks at the hard work .
and often we just ran out into a <unk> and <unk> us .
anyway , what we found is that both digital <unk> &apos;s in reality , and the same goal <unk> , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slowed down and down the big <unk> with six <unk> of interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big and whole , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals were going to be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool here that we &apos;ve discovered -- really , really cool out of the socks .
down there , the gray box , and on top , you see the <unk> .
now what this thing does is that it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- so , for example , <unk> and <unk> code -- and it &apos;s <unk> code that &apos;s still available during the attack , who &apos;s still attacking the <unk> data .
and in fact , this false explosion is taken from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> is fed up with <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> in the <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more potent .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> , where a human <unk> cannot respond fast enough .
so , in a power station , for example , if the great <unk> is going to be fast , you have to <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re at risk , you can do some bad things .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> is going to notice .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would be so good working -- in a power plant or a power plant .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- the <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> stick on the stick stick , how we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to disseminate .
you just have to spread that way .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the greatest issue of goals is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most profound environments .
we have to make the consequences and we start preparing for better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported much of the fact that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the driving force is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the superpower superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you so much for letting us have a <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years trying to place me in situations that are normally very difficult and at the same time .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i &apos;ve been working on a <unk> -- dangerous .
i was filmed with <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days that i spent nothing to eat here , getting fun at the beginning , a little bit of difficult in the middle , very dangerous .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to come here in a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would be a little bit different .
some of you may have heard about a couple of weeks ago i put an ad on ebay .
i sent out a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> my tedtalk in 2011 .
but aside , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some pretty awful situations in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could prepare for me , nothing could work on me on something so difficult and as dangerous as with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is make a film around <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so what &apos;s going on in the &apos; 50s , <unk> <unk> , is that everything , from up to the bottom , from the beginning , from the beginning to the end of the end , is the <unk> , which is the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these guys are going to be with the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to note .
it was &quot; in eternity for always . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to be brand the x , but we &apos;re going to be secure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category every possible thing in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;re going to sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe that you ever wore ...
the greatest <unk> car that you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so the idea is , apart from one of the reasons , that brands are part of life , actually , to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of this film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love to be able to make sure that if <unk> would help me realize this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; look , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how this will evolve ?
how much money will it require to do that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to get them to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth it anyway , some really <unk> brands .
now , who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer ?
and the answer is absolutely most likely .
but is it a difficult thing to film about film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... meaning , not so optimistic .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at people that they have to do it with them .
there are some places we can apply .
let &apos;s put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; let &apos;s see the camera from &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out it was really , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
and just so disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
none of the wanted to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product so many people can see it as possible .
in particular , in the world today , in this context of new and old media and the <unk> media -- isn &apos;t it the idea to be in this new exciting new exciting media that the mass does this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , that was not the mistakes .
that would have no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this image is about is a problem .
you see , when you enter transparency at the <unk> , this is one of the first images that appears that .
i really like your , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; immediately , <unk> , characterized by <unk> and access to information , particularly what <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we hear a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president , says , even our leaders say it .
but when it comes to the fact that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented .
but why ? now transparency is fear -- like this weird bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like that strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is there more ?
a whole dish very cool .
that &apos;s a very risky thing .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father , the father , and he &apos;s sitting with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , three versions , there are three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who do big , giant , giant <unk> , and i have friends who do little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> <unk> , say that the reason their movies are so successful at the <unk> is that they have .
and then my friends who are doing little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we have to compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see ban in the movie ?
always if i &apos;m going to go on the way i &apos;m going to open up , and you &apos;re going to open the <unk> , you get <unk> .
and every time i get somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so much ? you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you want to interview a little bit before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; they will have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well for women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now , i can answer all your questions and give them an <unk> frames .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re brand a brand call .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , you know -- you know , remember people on ban -- that &apos;s kind of what we &apos;re interested in .
in the words of the words of the words .
ban is <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way that you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes up to positive , unlike &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we get them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh air .
these things like this have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , which is like , <unk> .
i want you to tell me something about your brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like happy clothing .
<unk> <unk> hit <unk> , except at the <unk> .
all right , what is the brand business ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably the <unk> glamour .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff .
but normally , i have a <unk> , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> <unk> .
so , the brand two : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : part of a lot , in part yogi , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> around the country .
so i think my brand is .
this is my brand , <unk> industry .
and your brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
brand five : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the <unk> , but i often look at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what was noticed is that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for you , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first image is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like this with your thoughts and feelings about them themselves .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and so on .
all these things come and start from a place , and i came up with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you is to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is this to the mind and feelings about them themselves ?
it &apos;s like i wish to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like curious things .
tell me about why &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what is the <unk> ? what <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you who aren &apos;t .
what else did they go through ?
do you have to be afraid , in which kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for patience .
yeah . now .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what makes it come .
there were quite a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her <unk> had two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction in it .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both .
what other brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii , mini , mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if any of you would ask you to describe their <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? are you going to get blood in <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
is it something that a little calm , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh , <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , failed and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate what ?
is it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
over the course of the movie we had more than 500 companies that were up and <unk> and <unk> the &quot; no , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control of this movie because they didn &apos;t have control of the last product .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using today to be using the <unk> of the brain , and to make movies .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> were banned .
in the entire city for five years , for five years have no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school in school where companies are going to their way in <unk> schools , across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies might not really have their interest in the meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people get to think that our world challenges .
and what was that for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
now , since the film &apos;s film festival film had its movie , we can look at this .
it was the <unk> in january , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million <unk> of this movie .
this is actually just a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film is not leaving yet .
you don &apos;t even have it online . no <unk> .
he hasn &apos;t come out of other countries .
well , finally , the movie has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every single <unk> that we were talking about , which is to make their customers recommend .
something that i think that i think is that if you take your chance to arrest your chance , grab risks in those risks .
i think when you keep people from it , you get closer to the failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid your employees , you know , you &apos;ve got to get a profit .
i have to feel that we need to take people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to be not afraid of the possibilities that you might have .
finally , in progress , we should embrace the fear .
we should be in the cage in the cage .
do you welcome the fear . you know , welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a big taste full of it , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it takes us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they were taught in transparency , &quot; from my good friends of ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations all over the world .
<unk> presents : &quot; they welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , morgan , in the name of this : what &apos;s happening right now with the <unk> ?
this is a great question .
i have a check on my pocket check on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at altitude of $ <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is also , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums , from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and access to her degree .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education of a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i didn &apos;t have a lot of museums , and i had no access to that art .
when i went to visit this museums , i started to learn a lot to learn .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- art accessible to making technology -- to bring technology together .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you just go to <unk> .
you &apos;re looking around in this museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , that van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re walking around and <unk> .
you want to get in the museum ?
you open the map , you jump with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to be in <unk> .
just further . a lot of fun .
look around them .
thank you , but the best comes .
so , i &apos;m in front of you , i met from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
when the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
this is now one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i click that off .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been recording with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion people ? &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you .
you can make it very easily and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is <unk> .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around and realized that there is something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the end , and i noticed that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , with some famous with a few known when i met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where one stick hit a stick with a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you a overview of what i &apos;m going to do , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but one second .
let &apos;s jump back to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding the details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s first , if you want to see van gogh this masterpiece , because of the creation ?
you go inside . you can actually go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in into one of my favorite photographs , so until i &apos;m actually tearing up this .
this is <unk> , never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many other ones , but there &apos;s no time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- whether you have rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum online -- you can make your own collection on your own .
just simply , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all over the comments , your friends , and sort of a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing that all the wonderful things here is not from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i might not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to live with this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s called properly online .
now , the biggest question that i &apos;m asked is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to add up the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two houses .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the obvious thing , and then half the right thing that the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this would be someone who &apos;s totally logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain at this scale ?
some of us might have decided to be one of these extremes , but i think that most people in the audience might look like this -- with a high school teacher , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be intuitive and intuitive .
and so i look at one of the people , in common with most of the experimental <unk> <unk> , which needs a good share of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition about the experiments in fact .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look at how it responds . and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they have evolved over the years is probably that one thing can be only at the time in place .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they didn &apos;t born with this idea , they evolved it .
i remember looking at a child playing on a <unk> .
he was a <unk> , not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i &apos;ll bet it &apos;s a very valuable lesson with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is the great thing that you don &apos;t just leave , and that you &apos;re going to stay in one place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they are not <unk> .
it would be an awful model for a <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you &apos;re playing with your particles , you can see all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics , a few years ago ; you had to describe quantum mechanics little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great mundane objects around us .
this didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t really enjoy the particles .
well , i play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean no one has ever seen a particle .
but i didn &apos;t like it very much .
because if all things are made out of particles , and all those particles have the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just should just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why this shouldn &apos;t be .
so i &apos;d better be wrong with all of the things that if we could somehow show that <unk> the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i took a couple of years ago to the right thing to do .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was <unk> in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
here i &apos;m up here . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here is a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it is like a certificate , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you can chip a computer .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of a <unk> pool of hole and the thing .
this thing has this thing that has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird stuff but then i &apos;m going to hear some other people , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want it to bother , or frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just as feeling objects .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only people , but the light that seems to them , and the wind , that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s over , and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece of metal <unk> , we had to <unk> all the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the light off , put it into a vacuum , and we put it up all the air and <unk> it to almost close to the elevator , was the piece of metal , to behave as always .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really moving .
instead , it &apos;s just because it &apos;s just there , <unk> it , the way it was , the way it was like this -- it &apos;s like <unk> and together .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vibrate at the same time and vibrate -- something that &apos;s only allowed in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really awesome .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and no way to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think atoms about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms from those of them where the piece of metal are still there , and the same atoms move the same atoms up and down .
just towards precise <unk> votes , it &apos;s <unk> .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom in the same time is two different places , which is the same piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth it for all of this year in the clean space space , because , you know , you know , the <unk> between a single atom and that piece of metal is about just like the difference between the little atom and the metal .
so if a single atom can be two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine that you would be at the same time of multiple places , how would you feel that ?
how would you handle your body in the room that your body is <unk> ?
there is another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , light <unk> and the box box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that looks like this as all the objects in the elevator really are only <unk> objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not right .
there &apos;s more and deeper than that .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should have decided we should be thinking about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about it , where they want to live and work on , they &apos;re given the opportunity to , between at least a hand , to choose new residents .
we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world that don &apos;t even have a single city available to you to welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more important than it costs them .
so , we could just get the world very simple , and maybe even hundreds of new cities were <unk> .
now , it may seem absurd to you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just trade up the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they did it .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you would be going to do in these homes , and the environment , and its environment , make law to avoid complaints and <unk> .
so it turns out that very hard to end up all these <unk> .
but you could go to a whole new place , a completely new building block , assumed the laws would support one of these such things and not <unk> it .
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments can create new surfaces that have enough place for a city and have given you a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that , you know , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform of reform .
in the summer in 2009 , <unk> was a major <unk> .
the next <unk> elections , won <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , whose program has both <unk> and <unk> .
he asked <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i &apos;m preparing to speak at tedglobal .
by improvements , and try and study through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city to reduce elements .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that , you can &apos;t cause existing standards .
we pay for new technologies , but for the progress of progress , it needs technologies and laws . and it &apos;s usually laws that help us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the <unk> link .
so , again , he showed him .
they were calling me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s go to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotel in miami in miami .
i tried to make sure that they are valuable to how much more valuable they are than they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , and think that a surface in some cases is worth thousands in some cases of dollars .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion at a time when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> , who said that we need to realize this project that it &apos;s important to do , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s important to do .
i was asked to get a lecture on the fourth and the fourth january of the fourth and fifth january a lecture .
so i have one another with some facts of <unk> that has been a graph like this , which has been trying to illustrate , that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of denver , and the picture is the new airport that was built in denver .
alone this airport is 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite got <unk> .
the audience faces were very serious and careful .
the leader of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line , which has come to new opportunities for people .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new possibilities for leaders .
we &apos;re in an area of danger .
this is from this place .
it just <unk> a thousand square miles .
and shortly afterwards , on january 19th , you voted with congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control that has been <unk> for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a low crisis , it was taken in congress for these <unk> <unk> with <unk> a voice .
all parties , all parties , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , the second time , it became approved to a voice .
immediately , after this election , between the 21st and 1960 , 24 / 7 of about 30 places in the world , a delegation from about 30 locations of the world who were most interested in the business of the world .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new downtown city , which built in south korea <unk> big as the city downtown .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after four years , after four years , to get to get the <unk> .
the other place that was really interested in urbanism was singapore .
there were two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so , if you think of it as practically , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; you &apos;ve already consider this land for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system , that <unk> allows you to participate , and it &apos;s also been working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered his supreme court to the site as the trial for the <unk> appeal of the system .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring in funding with one .
one of the things you already know has been understood , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many businesses who would love to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would love to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people around the world saying that they &apos;d like to live in a permanent place .
a million people leave every year and go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to <unk> their families to <unk> work , sometimes they have a single mothers who have enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s kids , they &apos;re trying to find their parents to find out their parents for a decade .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about building a completely new city ?
or in fact , <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of them around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from <unk> have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions they do on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently made a survey of 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , the average american , a typical american , is 70 .
it was also done recently a study of ceos in which they saw a week of ceos .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes that documented this ceo , and how much time they were making decisions that were related to the issues .
and they found that a average ceo &apos;s busy ceo have been busy <unk> tasks .
every one of these subjects , of course , made from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of your decisions were within about nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of your decisions required you an hour or more of your time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you are in the nine minutes of category one hour ?
how well do you think they &apos;re making decisions in it ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest <unk> of our modern time , which is <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hands , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today is , are you willing to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> convenience ; at least it was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 of a mustard of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we were still <unk> .
i loved walking in this business ; but at one point i was asking myself , well , how do you never do something ?
here &apos;s the olive <unk> .
they had about 75 different olive oil , including those who were locked into boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go and visit the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model that you have all these possibilities really , really ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists that would come every day , and usually they had the cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we set up a little bit right the entrance to the entrance .
we have six different tastes where we have six different tastes , or 24 , <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would be more people to stay on and try and stand ?
there were more people standing there , if there were 24 , about 60 percent when it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw ourselves in the case of what the people were going to buy .
now we saw the exact same effect .
from the people who were on the side of 24 , only three percent of a glass of <unk> .
the people who were left when they were six , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do the math , people bought six times more of a glass of <unk> who they had six to the choice of the choice .
now , not to decide not to make a glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that <unk> decisions are influenced by us .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to tell you a study that i &apos;m talking about with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we &apos;re making the decisions for almost a million of a million americans in the entire united states of the united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that was possible to be able to be able to do a <unk> plan , the <unk> plan , the probability of being saved .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that would offered people anything between two to 59 different teams in the field .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered that , in fact , that , in fact , the participation was less .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that two fund offered <unk> had offered a <unk> in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that nearly 60 fund , the <unk> had been on the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you were to participate in <unk> , if you were to get a choice , it has negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate in it , rather than the more opportunities they were available , the more empowered you were to choose to choose and vote it on .
the more opportunities they were available to them , the more they put their entire money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , is to make any of the decisions that someone would recommend if their future resources are important .
now , in the last 10 years , we have seen three essential negative consequences that provide the order of more and more choice .
they push the decision -- push them , even if it &apos;s against their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that they do less happy , even if they do it better .
the main reason that we &apos;re looking at this is that maybe we &apos;re looking at this giant shelves full of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t actually compare the comparison and make something out of the amazing offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways , and they &apos;ve tested them just in their business .
first of all : limited .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true of true as today is that less .
the people are always concerned about what i &apos;m saying .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble <unk> , the different head and <unk> types of 26 items , you have a increase in sales .
when the golden <unk> corporation corporation her 10 at the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> , she experienced that the profits around 87 percent -- a result of each other , the price of sales and reducing .
you know , the average average <unk> , today offers to eight products .
they have a typical walmart offering them today .
but the <unk> supermarket , who today &apos;s <unk> supermarket is <unk> , and they &apos;re only offering 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
every single harvard person takes automatically in a <unk> part .
those who really want to create a choice , they &apos;re not going to be a fund , they &apos;re not <unk> .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it down .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be <unk> , they can &apos;t do it either . &quot;
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he &apos;d be willing to offer all of the people in this audience to the most beautiful road on the planet .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read them that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i want to give you clap , if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary .
okay . everyone who &apos;s willing to assume gary &apos;s supply .
are that all that ?
well , let me show you a little bit more .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that it &apos;s an objective of the first time when the first time had more information , when the second time , but i would guess it would be a way to guess it in the second time .
because the images made it real for them .
which brings me to the second technique that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding that the difference between ways to understand the difference is to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and this consequences and specific felt .
why are people going to spend on average about 15 to 30 percent more , if they use a credit card or a credit card for cash in cash ?
because it &apos;s not a real money we feel .
and it turns out that if you make it meaningful is something that feels a very good tool , so you can get people saving more .
and while that meeting , we have these gathering directions just as close as they used to have , just added a little thing .
the little one that we &apos;ve been doing is we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if they would save money .
the third technique : <unk> .
we can handle more categories than to deal with more choices .
here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that it turns out in the <unk> supermarkets and down in the northeast of the northeast field , varies the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines up to the <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
because the categories of things i think can be .
here &apos;s two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called <unk> .
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the ad is on the right jazz , you clap them hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and it &apos;s on the right hand side , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a profoundly <unk> <unk> .
the categories has to say to the <unk> thing , which is not the choice .
and this problem is a lot of time when you look at the long lists of all this fund .
who do they actually want to inform ?
my fourth technique : premise for complexity .
it turns out that in fact , we can deal with more information than we think , just simplify it .
we need to slow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated choice : buy a car .
here is a german <unk> , which gives you the opportunity to offer your car to completely <unk> .
you have to make 62 different decisions in your car .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that you provide a choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half the customer is going to be done by the many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients goes from the small opportunities , four gear , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how are they interested .
when they use the <unk> in the decision to make sure that they &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that the people who go from the very few <unk> are always going to go and choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the very little choice to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is that the sequence is to presented in this information .
when i start with the simple start , i study like i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the gear is choosing , i don &apos;t have anything about my preferences when it says i &apos;m going to pick it up .
it <unk> me as well as a product of the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m ready to get me to get interested in this .
let me summarize .
i told them about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- limited -- they &apos;re going to be the <unk> alternatives -- they &apos;re making it real ; we can prepare for more categories , less options , less opportunities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people that they service .
because i think the key to the best choice is to pick up the choice .
and the more we choose to pick , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . a japanese look at me .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how video <unk> are going to be , and then then , why is that important .
we all want to be stars -- <unk> , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that &apos;s infinitely difficult .
but <unk> have allowed us all of our creative activities , that we can be <unk> our creative activities , in part of the culture .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but youtube hours of video per minute , and uploaded to youtube .
and again , it &apos;s going to be a tiny percentage of times , and it &apos;s going to be thousands and hundreds of times thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> this video that he had filmed his house in the yosemite country .
in 2010 , 23 million had been looking at this .
this graph shows how it looked , when the video was very popular for the first time .
actually , a viral video is not a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing when you get high mountain mountain <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was already in january .
what happened here ?
and then jimmy came .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that finally made the video eventually .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> us to imagine new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
rebecca <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been looking at nearly 200 million times .
this is what the graphics look like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it doesn &apos;t seem to be done .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , friday friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , many blogs began to write about it .
michael <unk> <unk> nelson from the <unk> science of theater was a guy who made a joke on twitter .
what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> would take a point of view with a big audience and accelerated process with that process .
and then this community formed this community of people who shared this big <unk> , and they start talking about it and playing with it .
now , there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on youtube .
already , in the first seven days , there was a <unk> for every single <unk> .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was going to look at almost 50 million times .
and if you hold this for crazy , you should know that there is a <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats looking at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
and somebody made an <unk> version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground that was made by a stupid joke to something we all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something that we do .
who could have been <unk> ?
who would have predicted who would have predicted black or rebecca black ?
what kind of <unk> did you do in writing that sort of <unk> ?
in a world where every minute two days will be uploaded , it can only be a unique and unexpected kind and unexpected <unk> like this .
i &apos;m not very interested , i was not really interested in doing this , when a friend said to me , i should look at this wonderful video , about a guy who <unk> in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i don &apos;t have a ticket , but often there are disabilities who don &apos;t let you go to the <unk> .
so this is a very surprising and <unk> , casey &apos;s funny idea , and his case was looked at for five million times .
and this is what we &apos;re doing for all the new things we are creative .
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , which is that everybody has access to the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber was -- justin bieber -- did the beginning of youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas of light .
and today , we all feel like the owners of our popular culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not hitting the media today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle which is still combined .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope and liberty of its home was together .
if you &apos;ve got a waste of <unk> in front of you in front of your eyes , you &apos;ve got to be a single waste of your life .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now .
he moved back into silence .
he died , broken by history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories are .
my grandmother never forgot his life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job , to learn that the story has really been trying to help us , and we &apos;ve been through it .
the next thing that shows you , like a boat in the early <unk> silent , is lake <unk> .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her life , they gave a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat still on the sea , as a boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had pirates before pirates and rape and death .
as most adults , my mother wore a little <unk> on the boat .
in a <unk> , i would have my sister and i , you know , even drinking my grandmother .
my first memories are by the boat -- there &apos;s <unk> of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the bug , the length and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came up with the pirates , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or the <unk> of the motors that six hours didn &apos;t want .
no apple had no apple tasted like this .
after three months in the refugee , we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who build a new life together .
we were going to put us in <unk> down , one of the <unk> <unk> suburban , which is the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence told me that was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the odor smells came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> have been broken between people who had in common with one thing in common .
my mom worked on farms , then on a <unk> assembly line , six days , double <unk> .
they kind of got their time to find their english and <unk> .
we were poor .
each dollar has been given , and has got into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it . mostly , the new stuff that came out of the second hand .
two couple <unk> for school , each of them to cover holes in the other .
<unk> <unk> to the <unk> because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
home where ?
something <unk> inside me .
there was a meeting at reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get you out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister , and i slept in bed .
my mom was exhausted , but we were told each night , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mom was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came to the end , so i could wake her up .
she opened a <unk> , then she made a <unk> and she &apos;s another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> change , angry and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were set up .
i lived in <unk> .
in one way , i was the classic asian student university , the <unk> demands themselves .
in the other part , i was involved in suffering , the tragic scars of violence , wearing the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many received help over the years .
and because of this aid , i was chosen in my last year of <unk> as a young weapon of the year .
and i was <unk> to the next <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> from <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social <unk> , who she had never heard of .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she reminded me that i was so old as they was so old at the time when we climbed the boat .
no way .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , they lived on the borders of the possible .
and even though i had conclusion , i realized i could not expect me to come up with a career in law .
there must be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easily collapse to the collapse of the horizons , it can mean , you know , you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i went to see enough out of my house , and i went to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as much as you do it .
possibilities that are not allowed to be explicitly .
there was a energy , there &apos;s an infinite optimism , a strange one , that &apos;s the humility .
so i was following my feeling .
and i &apos;d collected a little team of people who are <unk> , and they were a <unk> challenge .
for a year , we had no cents .
at the end of one board , i cook a giant soup soup that we shared with us .
we were working late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i made the decision to draw into the united states .
it &apos;s just a journey there .
my gut reaction again .
three months later , i went house and the adventure left .
before i talk to you , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died short after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman , whose mother she hit .
in her husband , she worried about her husband , she took him by trial and <unk> in their own case , and she was a greater <unk> than she won .
&quot; not said , &quot; come <unk> .
i just took up in a hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and they were sitting in a buddhist temple .
we told her stories and <unk> her that we were still with .
by midnight , the monk and he said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
and she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you hold them tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they haven &apos;t left them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through the women .
see , who we were , who we were , and how life has shaped us , now we can see that the men who might have come in our lives , we had come to the <unk> .
that defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every wave system , <unk> <unk> of the engine , the big horizon , <unk> of the engine , the long horizon .
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to this , and i could make it safe .
and also , <unk> is a mother , today &apos;s fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because this is a picture of , of course , with his camera .
but i still began photography when i was my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
i put together it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera was using the process , it was actually in planning .
and when you take a picture of a camera ends with a camera , when you put it on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about photography , at the right place to be at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s beginning to the process when the cause is pushed over .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> street .
but it did an unexpected twist .
and still a realistic level .
or pictures like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like it could have been .
photos where you have to think about a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s about to capture an idea , as really a moment .
what is the trick that it makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details of the colors or the colors ?
is it about the lights ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is illusion .
in the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can look at a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly sophisticated objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , in a particular way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if there might be .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we cheat our brains because our brains are not quite sure that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in bringing pictures .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so things that make a realistic picture look , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things we don &apos;t think about in our lives .
but if we &apos;re able to combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a viable outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
and , you can do something special , like this .
so the first rule is , put together the same perspective .
second of all , put together put together put together .
and these two images are <unk> these two demands -- at the same height , and the same <unk> .
and thirdly , it &apos;s about making it possible to make it possible to make it different , where the individual images start connecting it with it .
it &apos;s impossible to tell you how the photo actually was put together .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s a landscape of a landscape , and the bottom one was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of all of them .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to find them to find the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> .
the bank comes from one other place .
the <unk> is from a quarry run .
and yes , i even had the house on the island of red <unk> to look at it .
so to get a realistic result , it &apos;s about to get out of me .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and this is about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very well planned .
and then if you do good images , it can be quite beautiful , and it &apos;s also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that we can see is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> was , you know , it &apos;s <unk> .
and they &apos;re not particularly scientific , and it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , what &apos;s going on ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we want to think that this is one of the main problems that everyone -- perhaps most of the electronic electronic failures , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> , a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on it .
and every morning i do that .
and yeah , i have a job as you might recognize .
i have my job with 95 pounds of <unk> .
it works very simple : every time i jump to the scale , you send my data on google health data .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to get from my <unk> <unk> , so you can see where my <unk> is because it &apos;s not just in the moment where i &apos;m going to take care of support , or use it in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe that &apos;s what i &apos;ve known to you about 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i wake up on my <unk> , and people talk to me before in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a smaller lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients because it could be used against obesity , or it could have patients smoking patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to get into some kind of game games to get their health better .
after a week , comes the market .
there will be this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be on an iphone or so forth .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure to measure their blood pressure , and for example , to share with other people &apos;s than share .
take a time to use that easily , and start embracing patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but by <unk> .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all of the atm machines are around <unk> .
we still know one where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patients ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> was to find out .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> <unk> .
we set up a website and a <unk> question , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed .
and over 10,000 , we were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we designed a <unk> system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and you &apos;re collapsing , you can use your iphone , and the next few weeks , you can save your iphone to save your life .
and today , we don &apos;t want to just do this as a <unk> , like the product called itself , but also to introduce it to a <unk> .
and we want to bring this into a global level .
and we ask for our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us to behave like <unk> <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation , you &apos;re going to get your own dye or someone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask for is that companies all around the world <unk> us to <unk> this <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or a technician , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please join us , and try to improve your health , not just to make you better , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> <unk> , that we force ourselves to conservation , by doing ...
... it <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh , a moment .
it may take you to <unk> .
now -- we can skip that way -- i &apos;m just going to skip a bit more .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over there ?
okay . thank you .
the code is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we &apos;ll let them work with <unk> .
instead of send them in the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what you can do with technology today .
so you meet al .
al is a <unk> in boston .
how did he get to look at this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston on the &quot; code for america &quot; program .
they were there in february , and it has last february of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never <unk> this fire <unk> .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , did something else , and that was , the residents , the sidewalks freely freely freely in front of these pieces .
so he did what any good engineers do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you <unk> to <unk> it when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al qaeda .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very humble app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any <unk> .
it &apos;s spreading rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city of <unk> that he could use this app , not for the snow , but in order to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to test them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to use the app to clean up the citizens .
and chicago , she just introduced them to the <unk> of <unk> when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use that app .
and she spreads that <unk> , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t really work that way .
the software conservation software takes a few years of software .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston for three people , and for three people .
it was about a way to find out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we were told later that if it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have been two million dollars .
and this is still nothing .
there are a project on the california law that cost the taxpayer to have two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from <unk> , and then a kind of shot of a shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think she should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that you represents a new generation that the problem of government <unk> -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re doing very well in the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who are making the tools that we need to be effective together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all across the country who get up and get up and write every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
today , a lot of people have given government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you that you &apos;re talking about it , because things change things .
politics don &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government will give us their power from us -- <unk> you : &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government , when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it was the government to choose the public &apos;s office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s most of all in communities , to be <unk> .
this is the call for service and information .
that &apos;s where you come out , normally , if you <unk> in your town .
scott , i get scott <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . give scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
and boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write the app .
this is work very smart people in the office of new urban <unk> , in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them removed ? &quot;
but what happened with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talked to human .
but in &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; all public can see that everyone can see .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next entry we got , &quot; i went over there , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , honey <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of a platform .
i &apos;m rather talking about a platform for people to help and help others to help others .
a citizen helped the other citizens , but the government played a central role here .
it connected these two people .
and you could have to connect them with government services , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and flexible alternative service .
when a neighbor helps the other , we make our communities better .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is vote .
this is because government like the government is on the top , and politics are the top <unk> .
and what is underneath it is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own this thing that we own , and we &apos;re paying for it to be something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us to do , we have to do a bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> occurs .
we have to be on the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned that has written a very detailed <unk> report that &apos;s a very detailed response to the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s not being active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to have the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we achieve what we need to do without improving an institution to make all the institution that can cause everyone to act ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology can make it possible , the function of the government is fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by providing society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the right systems .
now the average age of fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with their vote for granted .
they don &apos;t fight that battle that we all fight ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can feel your mind on every single channel , and you can do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications to work that improves the government .
and these apps , let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a trash patch .
and sure enough , we would have this fire fire all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who receive taxes , they &apos;re paying and pay attention .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a short , boring slide .
... could you just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;d chosen from my studio .
it &apos;s not about the details of slide , but it &apos;s about the general shape .
this slide shows data of an analysis from us about the performance of <unk> structures compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many others , which we find in our field , a way of just a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step is equal to a power in the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we have to use this type of scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
a little bit clearer , because i &apos;m just going to draw something out of paper here .
well , why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to take another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then it would be on the <unk> scale , and then it &apos;s a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , it &apos;s changing the <unk> condition .
so if the <unk> campaign would be as fast as the <unk> progression , we could get <unk> in a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
that was never going to be on the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which increases all the few years .
and the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t see it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that all over the course of course , and forever as fast as it continued .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like this , up to something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s what it is about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think i &apos;m going to think something like this .
it &apos;s really , it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often want to ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a kid in 2000 , and people often spoke about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go on .
so in other words , the future is due to a year since i &apos;ve been in this world .
and i think the reason for that is that there &apos;s something on the <unk> .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now , there &apos;s no meaning to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different , that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now not make sense .
now , i want to talk about what could be this , this transition where we &apos;re currently in .
so to make this happen , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things , which is really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i believe in order to really understand this , we have to step back and look at the thing at a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the <unk> of life .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of the <unk> chemicals .
now , when you &apos;re looking at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how you do it .
some of these oil oil spills brought a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside .
they were all that way , started to <unk> .
these little oil oil spills were the <unk> <unk> .
however , these oil spills were not about alive , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , it divided chemicals into the more unequal quantities .
so each one was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> , which had been <unk> <unk> <unk> faster than any other and integrated more chemicals and shared chemicals and shared chemicals .
so these <unk> <unk> to survive longer and they <unk> in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if you did a trick on an abstraction about abstraction .
in any kind of a way that we don &apos;t really understand , these <unk> have learned the ability to get information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for cell as being information , and in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , you have in this <unk> , evolutionary way of found a way to them , which allowed them to be <unk> of what they were made of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is to store this kind of information over the time of 2.5 billion years into it , which is the same .
in fact , the recipe for us is , which is the recipe for us , which is the exact same code .
every being used to use the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can , only for <unk> , ourselves in this code .
and i &apos;ve been here 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the distance from <unk> <unk> .
in it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code consists of normal letters that we use to use the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve got it <unk> .
so if someone would like a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus , and it &apos;s <unk> .
so what is the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting one .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which were started to communicate these cells and share these information , so that communities of cells evolved .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
this is the reason why it grows to antibiotics .
now , some bacteria figured out how they can stay away from penicillin in the dna , and we have a lot of bacteria in the dna , and we have a lot of bacteria , which are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
that communication allowed us to now have the reasons of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat .
so they either have survived together , or they went down , and that meant that when a community was successful , all of the individuals have been successful , all the individuals over the course of the community remain <unk> and <unk> .
now the <unk> is there , where these communities are so close to the fact that they determined , the recipe for the whole community in the dna .
and the next interesting thing took about another billion years ago .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of a lot of <unk> that act together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also an <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked themselves anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evolve , so that the level where evolution was happening , no longer the single cell , it was the single cell , but the whole <unk> that we call the organism .
the next step was in these communities .
the <unk> began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything different than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the neurons that are built up these <unk> .
they started to train the specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding , understanding information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- that &apos;s what happened in the period of a single organism &apos;s lifespan of a single organism , instead of over these evolutionary periods .
so one organism was able to learn , for example , learning a certain fruit of fruit , because she loved it and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could be done within a single organism lifespan by hundreds of thousands of years , whereas from hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned from the individuals who had died of these fruit , because these <unk> weren &apos;t there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> using this particular <unk> process , because evolution could be used in a individual .
she could be able to take place inside a time .
what happened after that , the individual organisms , they found a way to communicate .
once , as an example , the <unk> <unk> is known as a human version of the human language .
but it &apos;s quite amazing invention if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and there &apos;s basically <unk> notes from me in the hope with so much <unk> idea in your head , which is a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we &apos;re taking a very complicated , turning it into sound in sound , a sequence of sound , and creating something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve started to abstract , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that we have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods -- the abstraction of our methods , let &apos;s present .
the invention of language was a little bit in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on , all of our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together , which is much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to continue to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been far beyond .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you also saw <unk> little <unk> where he &apos;s shown a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right before your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> <unk> again .
the first steps of the story that i told you about is a billion years a piece of play .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and those next steps , how electronics , seem to be a few decades .
so the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- if something is more <unk> .
the more changes it , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feeds on itself .
i live for a living by building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently , but the recently worked out of computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any transistor transistor is power in <unk> .
it has billions of them .
and it makes it partly with the methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in recently , is the evolution itself .
that &apos;s where we install a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on inside the <unk> .
in order to call , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that made from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> please a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now , please take all the judgments of these random chosen instructions , run all the programs , and pick up those programs at the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i sort of numbers sort of <unk> , which would be a simple example of what i &apos;ve used to do for that .
so , find some things that are most likely to include numbers .
now , of course , the chance of random instructions is the instructions that you can just sort of numbers out of coincidence , so probably none of the instructions .
but one of them , with one of these , with a little bit of luck to the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences of the sequences that my <unk> are on the next .
in store these , <unk> the rest .
now , <unk> all the <unk> that have <unk> the numbers .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction .
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the characteristics of the two programs .
so , i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that come a little closer to the shift than others .
say , &quot; please this process again . &quot;
<unk> it again .
maybe a few mutations .
and try this up again with another generation .
all of these generations are very few milliseconds .
and so , i can take a evolution over millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or more complicated cases , or more complicated cases .
finally , i get programs the numbers perfect sort of <unk> .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have had to write by hand .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they are obscure and weird programs .
but they do do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you get the job done , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their life was just hanging out of it , whether they did it right .
i sat down in a 747 with marvin <unk> , and he <unk> a map of <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &quot; this airplane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which works together to make your flight safe . &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not equal to if it &apos;s too complicated .
so , let &apos;s start to rely on computers , which is very different from the classical engineering process .
it allows us stuff with a much higher complexity of complexity as it would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunities yet .
so <unk> <unk> is technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computer a lot faster , so that we can do the processes even faster .
so it &apos;s going to happen .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today from themselves today .
we raise off .
we have come to a point where analog is at the time , the analog to the <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite see what the hell we &apos;re creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after we get something else .
i find it very <unk> of us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what comes next .
well , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to stop here now before i &apos;m going to get <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan about two years ago .
i was in the sky with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that hasn &apos;t changed since the ancient indian era , &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
if we were going to travel at the indians at that time , we &apos;d gone into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
back then , when the great indian <unk> thirst had <unk> thirst , he took a bow , fired into the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were being replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to <unk> the sunset without a camera , and without my tweet .
i thought technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me a little silver <unk> .
this piece of 50 years became the most powerful thing for me .
she became an <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and <unk> into my imagination .
i got it like this , when we got to send our fancy clocks and cameras out of it .
they kept on being inspired by that .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic , rather than kill .
i started to illustrate books at 16 .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device of storytelling to storytelling all the readers around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text , and animation , touch and touch .
the storytelling is increasingly used .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to print a interactive ipad .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s a box , &quot; that box i &apos;m writing my name .
and i &apos;m going to figure out a character in the book .
and again , a letter to me falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really enthusiastic about this opportunities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean the wizard and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies found fireflies in a jar and always exciting .
this is what you have to blow up the ipad , and it &apos;s fireflies .
and that <unk> away from the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that there can be a whole galaxy in a single <unk> .
and therefore , there &apos;s every book , every world , a little <unk> that i &apos;m going to put in here in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always had maps , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and it &apos;s lights in the rest of the book .
it also shows in other places of the book .
i &apos;ll go in here .
it &apos;s also important to me to create something that is <unk> , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india have heard of india , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> was caught thousands of years in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we get them back , in a contemporary history of history .
it &apos;s a story that has been moved to new affairs , like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without <unk> .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you &apos;ve got to go out and get out with the camera of the latest images natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had the collections of <unk> rocks , rocks and <unk> .
somehow the children don &apos;t do that anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you &apos;ve got to go out and tag on a chapter of a flower and tag .
in another chapter one , you have to <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows a picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;
this creates a kind of a social collection around a digital collection of photographs you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of making magic to the world and to connect .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction at which you use the video of the ipads , and through <unk> reality , an animation of <unk> looks at a plant in front of the house .
now , at one point , the screen pays off the screen .
you have to do the sound of the <unk> , you can fly and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology are getting closer and closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we closer to the natural world and the magic , and the love of our childhood lives through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or prisons .
i spend most of my time with the most socially <unk> and in places where there is a lot of despair .
here at ted , to be able to see and hearing , how stimulating this is , i gave a very much force .
at the short time here , i became an obvious thing : ted has an identity .
you can see things that have the world in the world .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it makes sense and strength that wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher who are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn a lawyer in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who became dominated by a <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , powerful woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the starting point of many differences in our family .
she was a <unk> daughter .
their parents were born in virginia as a slaves born .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed very strongly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was loving too .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
so she pushed me so that i could barely breathe . then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; i said , &quot; well , if i said &quot; yes , &quot; she left me .
it was something that was going to be that you always wanted to be near .
the only problem with this was that you had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins is everywhere .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into the living room and all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and it went to me 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up and she came to me over . she took me over the hand and said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you know , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t do it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything what you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , you &apos;re going to love your mommy . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise with promise you &apos;re always going to deal with you . &quot;
i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next to me is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it falls to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;d promise to me is that you will never be drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old age , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and one year older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just so <unk> there as well .
and then he took a drink of beer and he offered my sister , and she took her , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . you &apos;re ok . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this , you know , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had what you had , you know , your sister had something . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you . do you . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still going to make yourself crazy about the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that you &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i should probably not do that .
this will be in public here .
i &apos;m a <unk> years old and i <unk> that i never drink one drop in alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i believe it is <unk> . i say it &apos;s identity .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people that they don &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
of course my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prison department .
my uncle died of <unk> disease .
and she believed that this is the issues that we have to take care of .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in jail .
today , 2.3 million are .
the united states today has the highest <unk> in the world .
seven million people are released on the <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
i think our world has radically changed our world .
in social , in socially weak and black share of despair , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male <unk> is in prison between 18 and 30 , in prison , in prison , or in prison , in <unk> or <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , of philadelphia , london to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men in prison , in prison , and with <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just shaped , but it &apos;s not just shaped by questions that have <unk> to do with poverty .
we have an arm in this country , which is a lot better when they &apos;re rich and guilty of being wealthy and guilty as poor .
wealth , not <unk> , influenced the result .
however , we seem to be content with it .
a politics from fear and anger have convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> developments .
now , my home local alabama <unk> them continuously <unk> the <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> .
and here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male deaths are held their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the <unk> of civic civic <unk> is going to be the <unk> of the civic <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that <unk> kids to death in prison .
in this our country in the country for children &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of technology .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , is it a human being , has a human being to die from him to die ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we see identity .
the other view is not : anybody deserves to kill a crime , but do we deserve to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , comes to one that we have for innocent loved ones , the <unk> and out of death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent innocent innocent people .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly anyone with an airplane , if for nine planes , go to a crash .
but somehow , we &apos;re going to create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i have my students african-american history of <unk> . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , which is time against the end of the second world war , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people had to fear <unk> .
or from bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet , there are a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and therefore , we don &apos;t really understand what the importance of our actions in historical context .
we are constantly flowing .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s very hard to talk about race , and i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get to the process of the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the <unk> is not to overcome the willingness to and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , they had these willingness to , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept talking about germany in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing them . &quot;
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death in germany .
and of course , they can never give them more in germany .
it was quite quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to kill us for the systematic treatment of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
so , as it would feel , in a world where the german state of life would be <unk> people , especially if the german state jews would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , there &apos;s the mental illness there .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not concerned with these difficult issues , those are the positive and the wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love conversation .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to a complex world .
for me , it means making the time , thinking about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , who never will be at ted .
but think of a way in which our own lives are integrated .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we rational , so we certainly do .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s these <unk> , which i believe that they &apos;re driving , not just to be open for all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the great <unk> politician , once said ,
as we were fighting in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do anything . but what we needed most is hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be , sometimes in <unk> places , to be witness .
this mental orientation is the essence of what i believe is that they need to be involved in .
there &apos;s no gap around technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears in poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care .
she will touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink .
so these women were met and they were just <unk> .
and down to the city called me <unk> , and then said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks , come into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and stopped .
it was always inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day , i sat there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours turned to woman for us , i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say <unk> , say , &quot; well , tell me the same thing as the same thing .
what do they try to do ?
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
people want to help people who were convicted of innocent people .
we want to fight bias and discrimination .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without a different <unk> .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death death .
we want to eliminate <unk> .
i gave talk to my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then <unk> <unk> to me , and i put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways of making those challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity is dependent on our humanity .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i learned some simple things .
that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something to him , he &apos;s not just a <unk> .
even who someone kills , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because it &apos;s like that , there is a fundamental human that needs to keep the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , a society &apos;s not going to be measured by how they get their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the convicted <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing equilibrium . a story at the end .
sometimes i urge you too much .
i &apos;m getting tired , as we all .
sometimes these ideas ahead ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very harsh websites .
i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> and visit a clients who likes to be 13 or 14 years old and to visit a adult court .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
how does a judge can turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed up too long , and i thought , oh my goodness , if a judge can transform us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you also should have a wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think about it , i started working on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black customers like a privileged , white , white <unk> . <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; to treat <unk> .
i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and the police and the police , are being <unk> .
there was a crazy line that there was no longer <unk> in this country that there &apos;s just <unk> .
in the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming about this crazy player , or even writing it .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to the court as well .
a couple of months over and i just forgotten everything .
and finally , i decided , my god , i have to invite you to the dish and the <unk> case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed with overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so painful , so painful .
finally , i went from my car , and the staircase went to court .
when i put the staircase on the dish , there was an older man , black man , the janitors in the dish .
when he saw me , he came to me over and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and he came up with me .
then he did the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went into the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
did he say , &quot; mr. <unk> <unk> , have you put this crazy court ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we were talking about color , about poverty , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors and i looked at the janitors .
and he could see over the window and he could hear all the <unk> .
he went on and off .
finally , this older guy came up with a very common black guy in the <unk> and sat down behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
while the break in the pause came in , it was a <unk> that was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the elderly .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
i came to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but that it &apos;s the justice map of the universe .
that we &apos;re not designed as human beings completely as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our survival is going to survive every individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and creation , with entertainment and creativity and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell you about that , which is just to say , just to say , lose the point of eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen that in this audience , this community is an obvious thing to help and do something about them .
what else can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a spring in this spring , where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to do a effort , something that goes on to the politics of security .
here , in california , for example , in california , one billion dollars a billion dollars for death sentence a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all <unk> ends not with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all <unk> come from trial .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
so , this <unk> is suggesting that money in more <unk> and safety .
i think there is opportunity everywhere .
over the last three decades , the <unk> in america has expanded enormously .
this is a fact that it &apos;s a lot in relation to the elevated system .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
now , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find it in the classroom &apos;s class .
it was the <unk> a bag of drugs .
so the dramatic number of numbers come in the prison .
we have <unk> ourselves from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now , we have <unk> <unk> , <unk> people for always bringing bars on the side , for an <unk> , for the theft of theft , rather than you force them ; the things gave back the victims .
i think we need to do more , helping people to help people who are victims , not less .
and i believe that our current <unk> don &apos;t help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a string of the <unk> .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
so , bin laden is a increased increase in <unk> .
<unk> : famine in somalia . <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : dangerous <unk> .
6 : social decline . last speaker : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . <unk> nine .
different speakers : <unk> . tornado . tornado .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- but they &apos;ve been able to have the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media will prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are giving exactly these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second one day , every minute , our senses are much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we can &apos;t be more important than our survival is the first station for all of the information that the amygdala goes .
the amygdala is our early warning systems , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> all the information around all of the information for any of us in the environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to think about negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it <unk> , the demand is &quot; is true .
now , with all our digital devices , that &apos;s seven days a week , 24 hours a day all of this negative news is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is going to be worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the huge progress that we &apos;ve been doing in the last century is what we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so that it makes us possible to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water <unk> , water and energy , energy , we already have .
and as humans , we are much better at solving problems in a very long way , but then finally , to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
over the last 100 years , average life expectancy has more than doubled to inflation , <unk> .
child mortality has to be a tenth of reduce .
and that comes to the fact that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs have reduced <unk> .
now , steve pinker has shown us that now we live in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is the last 130 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we &apos;re in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined poverty .
remember , a great percentage of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , water , tv , television , mobile phones , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have to dream like this .
the basis of a lot of them create technologies , and they grow up .
so my good friend , ray kurzweil , has shown that every tool that is going to be that of moore &apos;s law on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and <unk> all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s about the cell phone in your pocket , about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and depression .
this is the result of a faster computers building faster computers build faster .
they slowed down neither of our big problems .
also , despite the logarithmic , on the left-hand side , it &apos;s up on the left .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer in watson ?
that was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for newspapers and for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the <unk> of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence owner was given to every single owner of an <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i here at ted here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all over these technologies at all , with special focus on how those can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services within a decade of positive life within a decade of people .
think about the fact that a group of students can influence life today from billions of people .
and 30 years ago this seems ridiculous .
today , we can refer to dozens of companies that are being done exactly this .
if i think about abundance , i mean , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to make a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating advanced goods abundance .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited dinner for the king of <unk> .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
but the king of <unk> got <unk> .
aluminum <unk> was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and conflicting .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made from aluminum .
although aluminum <unk> percent of <unk> takes place , it doesn &apos;t come from pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
so let &apos;s put up this analogy for the future .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is to stand .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , for the first time , it &apos;s been able to reduce cost solar power solar power in india -- <unk> rupees in 17 percent .
the cost of solar energy dropped last year by 50 percent .
the last month , this is published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , six cents per <unk> , versus 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , then we will have water in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember when carl sagan was the <unk> 1990 when it was on saturn , back towards earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that is covered to 70 percent .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent water saltwater , two percent is <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting right percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
it can create a thousand liters per day from different sources per day from different sources of water -- that saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all of that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been <unk> in the developing world with a hundred units of units .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola globally will apply that technology globally in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we also saw this in mobile .
you my goodness , we get to soon the 70 percent of mobile phones across the developing world from 2013 to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a cell phone <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> than president reagan .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication and communication that nobody ever could predict .
and it &apos;s even better , the things you &apos;ve spent and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and a picture , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are now going to be <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what we would expect in health care .
i had the pleasure of the last month , with the <unk> that so-called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> prize &quot; <unk> prize .
we ask questions about all over the world , all these technologies together in a mobile phone in a mobile phone , that you can talk with the device , because it &apos;s associated with ai , you can test it or test its <unk> .
and to win , this is a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the health of health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> sequence , which is not known for the heart , it calls it to the heart of the health and prevent a pandemic before you outbreak .
but now the biggest force that makes us a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the largest population against a population is a better education and food in the world .
in 2010 , we just had two billion people connected online in 2010 .
we &apos;re growing up by 2020 as two billion <unk> .
three billion new minds that we have never heard of before , we will join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic growth , i see one of the biggest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be able to use the <unk> healthier , and they &apos;re getting trained through the <unk> , and by doing that , they &apos;re going to use 3d printers and &quot; <unk> computing , &quot; and so much more productive than ever .
so what can you do about three billion , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> .
what about one set of new , never <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to make change and make change , for the first time ?
what will bring these three billion people ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that small teams that motivated through passion and focus , extraordinary things can create , things that make big companies and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know already .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this was a problem of supercomputer .
and this game was played by university and etc .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who have played online online games .
and it showed that the human pattern showed up the protein pattern of bright <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , what of tremendous trust me in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to make the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion other minds that we can work online to do online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s required .
we &apos;re expecting a few decades .
thank you .
i believe that we have to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical response , and i am .
and maybe i have long enough in business as i can allow me to give up a piece of my own false <unk> to give up this .
but before i come to my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re going to be close to the world &apos;s cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is filled with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turns out to be statistics and to make it a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to give you a number of statistics that i hope you &apos;ve heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat ends .
that means that the player is clearly three out of 10 beats .
this is the ball of <unk> , and he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not going to be able to throw the ball out of the first base , didn &apos;t get it in time , and the rule was in security .
three out of 10 .
do you know how you call a <unk> <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody from the rest of the four .
<unk> -- like ted williams , <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> , the last <unk> season , met 400 times over 400 times .
so let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more , or maybe a little less comfortable with that .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> , which is <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine you &apos;re in a remote remote region , and you have a beloved person with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> in <unk> with 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the <unk> <unk> .
and she &apos;s a <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe in the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be or a doctor or a doctor .
however , what we &apos;re doing is we included every one of them , including to be perfect with the claim .
never make a mistake , no one makes the details of thought to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i put in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> <unk> student .
in high school , brian <unk> said that brian <unk> <unk> would learn to be a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> in the nurses who <unk> in the toronto general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything memorized .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> every branch , every branch of the <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> .
and all of the time , i was more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew , if i knew everything , and everything , or at least as much as possible , or as much as possible , at least as much as possible , that i &apos;m immune to be <unk> .
and it worked for a while for a while , until i met .
i &apos;m going to show you a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman <unk> a sculpture to me .
at that point , i was struggling with the <unk> layer of service .
and it was my commission when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for <unk> .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i listen to her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i hear her breasts , i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering from <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of all of the blood pumps , is to get a part of the blood in the lung , and filling them out , so the <unk> came out .
and that was not terribly diagnosis .
and i put them on the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a period of a year and a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistakes ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take you up and do what i have to have , which would have been a call on my <unk> , so he would have had a chance to have a picture .
and he knew , he would have been able to be able to do additional information .
maybe i do it with good reasons .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take its responsibility , that i would be able to do , and i would be able to get to my patients without getting contact with it .
my second mistake was worse .
so i &apos;m going to put it home , i &apos;m going to give you a little voice , i tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not do that . &quot;
so , in fact , what i was so very missing is that i asked the nurse , which is , &quot; well , do you think it &apos;s okay , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said in <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be good . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and they brought them home .
and i went back to work out .
the rest of the day , i had this evening of feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i packed my things , <unk> the hospital , and went home to the parking lot , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home to my way back home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen a printer , but another three words that i know , and those three words that i know .
the other medical fear is also fear , but the <unk> is very , very well , because we &apos;re only seeing the patients so <unk> .
the three words , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s gone , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back to die .
now , about an hour after that , you &apos;ve got to come home after that , after i sent them home , and the family was called 911 , and the family came up with a blood pressure with a blood pressure on a blood pressure .
they were barely breathing and was blue .
the <unk> broke all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was shocked to go inside .
and i went through this rollercoaster because she came to the intensive care system , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized that she would never <unk> .
she didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , it was <unk> .
the <unk> day , she <unk> them -- woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you know , the name of those <unk> never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this .
if you do <unk> , you never do it again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is that i &apos;m going to do a <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s the one that says , not what you &apos;re doing , that &apos;s not what you do .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t based on my <unk> , he was very keen .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the <unk> <unk> and sure that i was not going to be sued .
but i hired these questions .
why didn &apos;t i have asked them ? why did i get home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why am i in medicine ?
but slowly , it took place .
i started to feel better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i said maybe i can feel better .
and i was <unk> that if i took my effort to perfection , and never put a mistake back to the <unk> that the voice could be .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he walked out of the door , he showed up his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> but the top <unk> and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately , he wasn &apos;t dying .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back to the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , made me feel free , and went back to the work to work back until it happened again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve lost two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a couple of things about that , especially if you think about it in a hospital , just 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there &apos;s probably no <unk> in their treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the kidney x-rays of the kidneys , when that was without <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient , and called the <unk> in the lower right sector .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> in order to <unk> him and asked my colleagues as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he did the <unk> in the lower sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was fine .
both cases of <unk> , <unk> me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim , but a total nonsense is .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i <unk> the little voice that tells me , what could i do with my colleagues ?
how do i teach you my mistakes , so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like right now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about .
when did you last when you heard about the last time of somebody talking about <unk> <unk> ?
oh yes , you &apos;re going to hear a cocktail party and you like to hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody else &apos;s own mistakes .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a <unk> in my hospital would have lost to someone the wrong leg , and i would have thought of him , i would have a chance to see him .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
it &apos;s completely denial from mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who are <unk> , and the ones that <unk> with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response , like antibodies who attack a human .
and there is the idea that if we are the people who make mistakes from the medicine that have a safety system .
but there are two problems .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day , in which one of the 10 people are either wrong or wrong , in which one of the <unk> is going to be a false or wrong more and more and more devastation .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians , they are <unk> <unk> .
in the united states at the end of medicine , the institute of 100,000 .
both of them are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t think so much as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in which medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a chest pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give it a easy breath , and all of a sudden , the history of contempt with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always the same thing .
and my patients are not cars ; they report their symptoms not always in the same way .
all of this is <unk> failure .
so if you take the system so , as i taught it , and all of the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s not at the end of it .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and then your <unk> , you &apos;ve come to see the head , then you see it down and swallow , and start to tell their stories .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment that puts them in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new formal doctor is a human being , knows about his humanity , accept it , is not proud of making mistakes from them , so that it can be passed on .
she shares their experiences with others .
it supports them when others talk to their mistakes .
and she shows others their mistakes , not to be <unk> , but in a loving , supportive way of all the benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes people that people fill the system with life and when it &apos;s like that , then people make mistakes from time .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m a <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn to get it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live .
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about the time to use it .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was here .
you may think he &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
he was actually collecting fish .
he described one of them as very common .
it was a <unk> .
in the &apos; 80s , in a great style , it was fish in a big style .
it &apos;s now on the red list .
this story has heard many times from the galapagos or from the other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> describe it as pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is to take a different concept , <unk> <unk> , illustrate .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i went to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t have it from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was <unk> and some <unk> <unk> .
there were <unk> of about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were living good at ghana average about average .
when i got back there , i was getting back to the fish half his size .
they &apos;re five centimeters in the measurements .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the luck to be there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells story about my <unk> in southeast asia in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , <unk> europe is a lot of <unk> .
<unk> used countries that were already caught in 100,000 animals , the industrial fishing fishing ship rather ugly ship .
and i was driving on it , and we made all the southern <unk> ocean , and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know it was the reason of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the bottom of the sea was <unk> , and then back .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
in one year , you &apos;ll have an elevation by and then begins with the used commercial fishing .
the reason is change . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be <unk> .
this is a dead <unk> .
they were not eaten , you threw it away because they were dead .
so we started a alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> will be <unk> out of fishermen , if they &apos;re in areas where never <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to documented .
we &apos;re changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
we fit our <unk> on the new level , and we don &apos;t talk about what was there .
when you get it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green part of your country , the green part of your country .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , they &apos;re completely natural .
every generation looks at the images of your conscious life at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and <unk> .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
but they &apos;re not taking the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal now .
we want to get things that are gone missing , or things that are not as gone as they were .
now , you could think that the problem was for people to be sure when they were living in <unk> societies , they were killing animals , and they were just killing a few generations of what they had done .
because , obviously , an animal that was very common , that there was a lot of times when it was <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a common animal .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why not perceived as loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the large animals , and the large fish .
they &apos;re less likely to get them .
there are a little fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientist , confirm it really differently .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you like in a earlier form of references , aren &apos;t the way you would like to make the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a <unk> project , who observed in this area of great <unk> , can &apos;t be used , or <unk> , doesn &apos;t usually be <unk> because he &apos;s not using science .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in sophisticated societies because they don &apos;t trust the world of the past .
this is the enormously big role that has a marine <unk> play .
because through marine <unk> , we basically put back the past .
we can make the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the <unk> changes , and very low .
and so the people who see a marine <unk> can see the <unk> , and that &apos;s how to benefit from looking at their <unk> .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they have no access to -- the people in the midwest ?
here , i think the art and the movie may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched -- aside from the <unk> , why were it so touches from the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little bit <unk> that we have lost in a sense .
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you is cameron , so it &apos;s &quot; avatar ii ii &quot; is spinning underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , you had to , if you had a typewriter , you had to focus on a typewriter in the <unk> .
they also had to take a sheet of <unk> from these typewriter <unk> .
the reason for that : the government could track government , where a text came from .
found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how that speech would limit free .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and there seems to be <unk> .
and that was an example , in which our own governments have the technology against us , the citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three things that are existing in the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge lot of money .
there are many known cases of <unk> , <unk> that made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from estonia in estonia .
that &apos;s alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss bank accounts accounts of the gentleman here , and on this name was <unk> million dollars , and on this accounts were <unk> million dollars as it was frozen .
mr. <unk> itself is in free feet , which is unknown .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to be worse .
the future will be most crime online .
the second one we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for money , <unk> like anonymous who do it , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
that &apos;s where we are , before <unk> .
it shows a performance , what happens when governments have their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody has been hacked , and had been hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior citizens the question , if he had it for possible , because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die of one such remote remote ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate , you need to have a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> services , for example , for example , <unk> .
but , you know , if you &apos;re in the foreign .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of <unk> .
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , in egypt , the <unk> in april , 2011 , the <unk> of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , the notes were in germany , in the <unk> government , who was the egyptian government for a few programs , which they were -- in very large of egyptian citizens , could capture .
they had sold this program for <unk> euro to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments <unk> governments with <unk> governments to be able to do with their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago we had something called <unk> <unk> , which was used by german <unk> <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a <unk> <unk> , then you &apos;re going to <unk> your phone .
but we are now far beyond that .
they tap their connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> , their <unk> .
so , if we think about these things , the obvious idea of the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t seem to me because i am a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while we today , in 2011 , our governments like to trust our governments is , every right we &apos;re getting out of it forever .
and we trust , we are blind to one every future government , a government that we may have , in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : modules , from cement , have measurements that fit together .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into the situation , building things that were bigger than us , building , a stone after another .
essentially , the <unk> was the building of our time .
six hundred years later , in 1947 , the lego came out .
it &apos;s called the automatically <unk> stone .
and within a few years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion rocks have been produced -- or 75 stones &apos;ve been produced for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to be beautiful , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego it made possible for everyone .
lego has basically the <unk> , the building in the world , and it &apos;s made a building for our imagination .
in the meantime , the next year at bell labs , the next revolution , the next one .
the transistor was a little <unk> that was <unk> us from a world of static <unk> building blocks of a world in which everything was interactive .
like the transistor <unk> , the transistor allows us to build more complex colonies , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> . the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts could be reserved for experts on us .
and eight years ago i was the media lab , and i began to explore this idea of how engineers do the power of engineers and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is output , blue is input , pink and orange , wires .
so , all you need to do is to connect a green and a green one , and they can build very quickly .
you put a green one green , and you can make light .
you can fit a switch in between , and so you have a little <unk> .
take a switch out to the switch , and you &apos;ve got a little <unk> , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
and put them in this <unk> for a more effect , and they made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and beyond that simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , that you need to program <unk> or <unk> gestures , allowing you to program <unk> gestures .
so , to slow it down is <unk> or slowing down , just just on this button and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea of <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want every single interaction on the world in a <unk> stone .
lights , notes , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> to kids and see them play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , how do you start the electronics that you around in the world and you &apos;re not learning in school .
like , like , the doors of the <unk> work , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod is to touch .
we &apos;ve got <unk> too <unk> .
so , for example , we had no idea designers with no experience of electronic things , which began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and they gave them some designers that have no technical experience -- just box wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> polymer , the fear of the darkness .
for those <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics , just another material .
and we want to do this stuff for all available .
so <unk> open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> download , download them .
we want to the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because the world we live in , this interactive physical world , belongs to us .
so , go ahead and start invent .
thank you .
