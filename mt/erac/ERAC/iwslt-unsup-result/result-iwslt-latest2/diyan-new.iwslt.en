and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to look at the <unk> separation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique <unk> of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can be only to meet hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world form a net of <unk> and <unk> life that <unk> earth , and for the best of the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are able to be able to be an amazing <unk> species .
and as the biosphere became strong , this happened with the <unk> -- only with more larger speed .
and the crucial component of this is the extinction of languages .
when every one of you was born in this room , the earth was talked about 6,000 languages .
now a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool that finds the soul of a certain culture access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , just half no longer in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught <unk> . that is , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be <unk> when the silence was <unk> to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , don &apos;t have a possibility to give up the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope of the ancestors ?
and yet , this terrible destiny comes in , in fact , somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , a elderly man dies and takes the last <unk> language of an old language with himself .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then , suddenly , you would recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
so today i want to take you through a journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to make you understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us that forget that i say , if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his .
take this child of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively different between the colors blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people depend on is <unk> .
they have a strange language , and a <unk> is called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who talks to a different language .
all of this is <unk> in the <unk> past , and the strange thing about these big houses , where they talk about six or seven languages , is that you never hear somebody learning a language .
they just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived in , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was first <unk> in 58 <unk> .
in 1957 , five <unk> tried to touch , and they did a <unk> mistake .
they threw <unk> photos from the air , which we would grade as a friendly gesture , and we forgot that these people had never seen something <unk> in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , nothing and <unk> found that this was the business plan of the devil and killed five <unk> with the <unk> .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just kill the <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
74 percent of deaths happened by <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forest that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps , and determine what animal species of this was .
to give a sense of this <unk> , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable faith in the <unk> , and <unk> is not a culture of black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the great world world was reading , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is going to go out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith . of course there was one and <unk> is just the <unk> of this very profound religious thoughts , which <unk> during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> .
but what <unk> does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gives us the minds .
the minds can be <unk> under the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to <unk> the soul of the living temporary , so that the <unk> is going to be the god for a short <unk> moment .
<unk> say the <unk> , &quot; your white goes into the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take you from the mind . how can you be made to be damage ?
look at this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without burning , an amazing visualization of the ability of the mind to influence the body so that this is going to be <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> in a state of the extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met were the <unk> from the sierra nevada de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , which <unk> the heart of the <unk> of colombia , and in the consequence of the <unk> , this people went into a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that have never been <unk> from the <unk> .
until today &apos;s day , you &apos;re going to run from a ritual <unk> . the education to the <unk> is very extraordinary .
and during that whole time , they &apos;re introduced to the values of their society . values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers to be responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so , <unk> are not <unk> , they &apos;re still going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
well , what does that mean ?
whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor which is defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon northwest .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> <unk> from the repertoire of the <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that are very similar to serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you saw the <unk> , as you <unk> this stuff , this substance that you make from different species contains <unk> .
and the powder is a bit like getting out of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not produced <unk> of reality , but the resolution of reality .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because , of course , through one in the human gut , the <unk> enzyme is going to be <unk> .
they can only be <unk> with some other chemicals that are <unk> that the mao <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> , <unk> from exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . so ask yourself .
how can these people get out of a <unk> of 80,000 species of plants that can &apos;t find these two <unk> plants , which , if in this way , can create a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of his parts ?
we use this great <unk> , trying and mistakes , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> , which you all see in a big distance in the forest that appear for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how they <unk> their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understood something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties of <unk> and you sing to one in a different <unk> .
well , it doesn &apos;t get you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
well , the <unk> of the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position of native , they look as <unk> and <unk> , but somehow <unk> the past , while the real world , which means our world , <unk> .
all cultures have involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t hear less in the sioux , when they were <unk> and arrow as the americans stopped being americans when they were horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology <unk> the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i work a lot , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinct of people will be <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people &apos;s lifestyle , is not just convicted , but in general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you didn &apos;t experience it on the <unk> level .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as the tag of the <unk> lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle <unk> with her holiness in the diaspora that people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- to be rich for the crime .
he was <unk> in the prison for two years to hide under their <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave thing was made in a <unk> .
one day they came out of a <unk> <unk> , and for these <unk> , they had to go to a heavy camp for seven years .
the suffering of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> mind of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really before a choice . do we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , created the poetry of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- just happened 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
well , this <unk> story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> to the meaning of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always working very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years in the <unk> of our rule , they were forced to pull out in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold , they used them to be their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> was originally made of fish that was made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid of the arctic night or the flying storm .
he <unk> out , he made his pants down from <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and when the feces started to <unk> , he shaped it into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the pages of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a different dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> .
so you can &apos;t do something from anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native of the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 to get the complete control over a area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , looking for the <unk> with his people and to reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
<unk> nations are sending our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
thank you .
we see a lot , many <unk> of digital photos here , which you can <unk> and continuously <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that can measure the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a number of scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a wrong display with very high <unk> , which is much higher than at a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical <unk> .
and this really reaches these ideas to end these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean <unk> and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we are also going to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s take something else .
this is even live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research on <unk> , who <unk> by noah <unk> , a <unk> of washington university , under the advice of steve <unk> on the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that , if we create this kind of opinion that we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the <unk> <unk> .
but the spatial structure of images here is actually the meaning of meaning .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more <unk> .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
so this is all <unk> , and they all are in the space in the relationship with each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft finally .
i &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> here .
i guess you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : everything is to the <unk> of professional <unk> , a pretty big number of you who were all <unk> in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of you are <unk> by faces and so on .
somewhere here , there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady that was actually recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment . it will now collect data from all -- from the entire collective memory of how , visual looks like -- and everything will be connected to each other .
all these photos are being connected , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the entire earth .
look at this as the sequel of stephen <unk> to virtual earth .
and this is something that is growing through the complexity that people use it , and the use of the user , is going to be larger for the user with the application .
your own photos are going to be <unk> , which has been a different person .
and of course , depending on all of this is the vast rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which were not only getting through <unk> or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand them right ? their software allows for a certain point , within the next years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world are basically going to be connected to each other ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want , you create <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the amount of <unk> information that many of these images have .
how if you do a <unk> for images where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image that is .
but how would it be if the picture connected them to all their images ?
then the scale of the <unk> and the amount that makes it really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you very much .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , the way i hope , in <unk> with other things you &apos;ve heard . and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections if you don &apos;t notice these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is the maximize of the good people of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , sense , a <unk> premise for the human .
if people have freedom , each one of us is for themselves to do things that maximize our public public , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more public they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , i think it would not come to the sense of question it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big one .
i just want to tell you something about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business by a <unk> <unk> -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in this one electronics business , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can put up <unk> million different <unk> plants from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have any phone side of the phone you wanted to , as long as he came from <unk> bell .
they <unk> her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . <unk> .
a result of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business now , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people into the business and ask this question .
now , do you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more <unk> than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to a doctor , and the doctor says you , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , you don &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they promote us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t get identity , we invent them .
and we invent as often as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person wants to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one and they could <unk> as fast as they could , and then get so fast kids like you .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did earlier .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have children , or do i have a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions independent of that , whether it means to make all the tasks i &apos;m going to get you and not get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day from every place on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions in terms of work , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our children in football , and we have our cell phone on the hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably is on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in which we &apos;re going to ask our child to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the <unk> of your child , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about that , so i &apos;m going to get to what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> way , is that he &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> , which <unk> the employer , took the participation for two percent .
they offer 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees take part as if it would only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> who are for choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you should choose to take it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , it never comes .
through the <unk> , they give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes it that the world looks like this .
they really want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s forever , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or the wrong <unk> .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfied with the result of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more possibilities there are , the easier it &apos;s to regret anything , that &apos;s <unk> for the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point today by telling how much the way we grade things is based on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to think , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that you &apos;re <unk> to , that makes you less happy with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few <unk> .
very expensive real life .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thoughts that he missed the possibility , day over day , to have a great parking lot .
<unk> <unk> happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are considered in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it now , and maybe it &apos;s too slow to do things .
but one more important point that he does is , who you decide for a thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re doing .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this is what i met when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all time .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans here , that &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; do you want to have a <unk> , slightly <unk> or <unk> ?
do you want <unk> or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
want to cut the bottom , <unk> , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , &quot; i like the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all this damn jeans and <unk> the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt bad was to have all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than they had only in a way .
when they came to 100 species , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was a <unk> compared to what i expected .
the add of possibilities in the life of people , inevitably , the expectations of people have to be about how well these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of the <unk> knows this . because , if you would , you didn &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was better than everything was worse than everything was bad , it was for the people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world in which we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you to hope is the things that things are as good as you would expect .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come from -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married to a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> is not always like a bad thing .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the <unk> , and you ask why who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is the question : she .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people meet decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re <unk> themselves .
clinical depression in the industrial world in the last generation .
and so the <unk> is that , generally , it goes better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember .
this is the official <unk> , the one that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a choice is better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice better than something .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time on the choice of our public health .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question , the thing about thinking , what all of these choices allow in the industrialized societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of you whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i talk about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is steve <unk> told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to <unk> car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry about that we are worse .
if something of what the people of our society can make such decisions to the societies in which people would have moved to little choices , wouldn &apos;t just improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , an advanced person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish that knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so everything is possible , take happiness .
they increase the paralysis , and they reduce happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost limited to perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is from a metaphor of <unk> , is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before the human genome and what that could mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many biologists tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we have digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world is the digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate life , or whether we can create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
so we decided that the only way forward is that chromosome in fact that this chromosome is actually allowing us to vary the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we create a chromosome ?
does it allow chemistry to create these really big molecules , what has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has become very slow , but still increased , and our last point would now be on an exponential curve .
we started with 15 years ago .
it actually took some years starting with a <unk> review before we made the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and could correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome <unk> x <unk> .
it &apos;s a little virus of the bacteria .
we made little pieces , we made a <unk> , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then <unk> from the cells and came back and killed e. <unk> .
recently , i talked to the oil industry and they said that they were doing this model right .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build your own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the <unk> was at a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes in the <unk> . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
a part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to <unk> with other <unk> to build smaller <unk> to build these together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of this letter -- these letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
first , we only signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we made the pieces so we could just break them up with enzymes , there are enzymes that fix these and put them together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with <unk> with the five to the <unk> letters , put these each other to make <unk> to put these together together , until <unk> .
in every step we produced these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these right big pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then these aren &apos;t just going to grow in e. <unk> , and it goes beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> that the biology uses to fix dna that can put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million wheel of radiation .
you see the upper field , that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything came together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move on the search for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve just used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , we put them on . yeast automatically add together .
this is not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see with the <unk> .
these are footage of a long period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve only done recently .
these are about <unk> letters to <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we print it with a <unk> of 10 and without the spaces , it would include <unk> pages , just to <unk> this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you do it in <unk> like we are , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the membrane .
in <unk> , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but only recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and can activate these .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here &apos;s the end , but we tried to get the process more .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed in a moment has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> , which are actually <unk> dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell was none ; the chromosomes that we put in .
it was <unk> in the cell , and realized the other chromosome as foreign material <unk> it , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we had put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all of the characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve gone through .
it may sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can , by moving the <unk> , change things pretty dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have <unk> that we might be able to create a new form of <unk> explosion in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in <unk> .
today , three people on this planet , for each of the year in the year , has existed , and within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge that is for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil , that &apos;s a hundred million <unk> on the day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material on the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from all the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of it .
we &apos;re <unk> in the first line to the boundaries of biological reality and to those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of these fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to create <unk> or drugs , new vaccines , we can change a single little team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> for <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> , and so on .
this is a recording of real <unk> that we work with , which you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of the fourth generation .
they recently saw corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that are going to be relatively soon that are going to have much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think biology , the only way biology is going to have a huge impact on food , or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as <unk> , and so we work on cells that go out that way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and this in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane from the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could just be <unk> , <unk> the co2 into the fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry . right . if you could not do that at ted , where else ?
but we &apos;re currently working on using the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you saw it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar too little when it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is how the future could possibly look at changes , can accelerate today of <unk> with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are light years from improving people . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that , thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s too far . and for all the ones that were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been seen -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a <unk> second after the beginning of the universe -- and this to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the wide , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas construction that you see the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine was going to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which <unk> the entire way to the lhc , then <unk> with a part of the lhc to make a rain from particles into the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the largest <unk> , or this , as someone went to the google side and found the front page like this .
it means we have a cultural impact next to the scientific economy .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wires -- these golden wires .
these wires lead to <unk> <unk> when the machine is running on <unk> .
well , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool it very far , you will call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the room between the stars , these wires can get the tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
this is how the wires <unk> and <unk> <unk> suddenly met <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
well , that &apos;s all still <unk> if you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and moved to about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way again .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up and expect first data in june or july , and put our journey on , to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , on a kind of <unk> , these accidents are the debate about the value of science and <unk> to such limits . it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is the fact that we reach beyond our boundaries is the value of things like the lhc .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books to write is my job , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that will ever change .
however , recent things are a little bit weird in my life and my career that has taken me to rethink my terms of this work completely .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i get to be treated as i would be <unk> .
seriously -- the end of the <unk> !
for example , they &apos;re all worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to <unk> this success ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re <unk> your whole life and never try to create a book that anybody in the world are interested in the world ? never again ? <unk> .
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
people said , &quot; <unk> are you not afraid to have success ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you kill the humiliation of a <unk> ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re going to get your life out long and never create something , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter <unk> of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> yes . <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m afraid of a lot more things that nobody would get out of .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this for recently and asking me , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that from someone should be expected , he was afraid to do the work that he feels <unk> ?
and what &apos;s right with the creative companies that they make us insecure about the common state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked if he was afraid to be chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how are you ?
it just didn &apos;t come out , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists didn &apos;t get the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
we writers , but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all the <unk> , seem to have this call to be mentally incredibly unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> from really great heads from the 20th century , who died young and often by their own hand .
and even the ones that are not actually <unk> , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said short of his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books has killed me a little bit further .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
the question i want to ask every one here is : is this idea completely fine ?
don &apos;t you feel about it ? because with just one centimeter , i feel like i don &apos;t feel that idea at all .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s taken to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we help live our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , the dark path of the guess is kind of <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m just in my career .
this is -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world is from the world that came from the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s highly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that somebody can bring to the nine o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink <unk> , and i don &apos;t want .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the <unk> , i seem to be able to continue writing a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
somehow i have to find a way from now to write a safe distance to real distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction will be on the writing .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that comes from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity , <unk> <unk> .
by socrates , he believed that he had a <unk> that <unk> him from further away .
the <unk> had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind <unk> a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the <unk> didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not completely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was <unk> .
so the people in the west were thinking about creativity for a long time .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational <unk> , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people called these or these artists , they call a genius -- instead of that , he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations for success .
i think that this <unk> has <unk> our artists of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative area .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eradicate the <unk> of 500 years of <unk> , not just killed in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that would <unk> really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything i &apos;ve heard when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that is -- like everybody knows , who has ever tried to make something -- so in other words , actually everybody here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , sometimes he can feel really <unk> .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
that would be <unk> over the country .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the earthquake .
she knew that in a moment , she could only do one . and that was -- in their words -- <unk> race , like the devil .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they missed it .
they caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into their body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in this opportunity , the poem came <unk> and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought , &quot; i mean , this is incredibly -- -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to be able to work , i have to stand up every day and sweat , <unk> and really uncomfortable .
but even i in my <unk> have <unk> this thing .
and i guess many of you also have done this .
even i had work or ideas that are <unk> from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we connect with relationship without losing our mind , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can create this can be tom <unk> . i was allowed to interview him some years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist , trying to do these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him and deal with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he drove one day on a <unk> in los angeles , and there changed everything for him .
he has no piece of paper ; he has no pen , he has no <unk> .
so he starts to rise this old <unk> in him , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be followed by this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it . <unk> .
but instead of getting panic , he just heard .
he finished all the <unk> and did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky , and he said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you not see i drive car ? <unk> .
<unk> , i look like i can just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> cohen cohen . <unk>
his whole <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was still as dark as the dark .
it could give a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing , which was not very tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it has been saved myself .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i reminded me how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i talked to my comment in direction of a empty corner of the room .
i spoke loud : <unk> listen , you , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , <unk> . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you have to show up here and <unk> your percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give up to the record , that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like following , and centuries ago , in the deserts of <unk> people , they were <unk> to <unk> with holy dances and music that were stopped for hours -- until the dawn .
these fixed were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you all have seen a performance like this in your life .
it was as if the time was <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> , he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t seem to be human .
it was <unk> from the inside , and from the bottom up , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
when something happened at the time , people knew what that was . they called it his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
if a artist in spain has done something <unk> , something magical , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> <unk> , there it is : a <unk> look at god .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancers wake up , and realize it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> of god in itself .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never come back to these heights .
and maybe never again will call god &apos;s name when he turns . but what does he want to start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence come from them .
if you may just believe that you are a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life going to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security in the last months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , powerful <unk> of my <unk> success .
what i need to say to myself all the time , if i &apos;m crazy , is : don &apos;t fear .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still going to be for your contribution , whatever he may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that &apos;s asked you to the side is , you decide for a short moment to show a <unk> of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> .
and if not , dancing , your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you in spite of all of them .
i believe in that , and i feel that we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all of this , just for you to have the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had almost three million years the size of the lower 48 states , <unk> 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very enough to the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and the <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> thing that happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which <unk> out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
this is a problem because the warming <unk> the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of <unk> carbon , which if he <unk> , is done by microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , this amount could double when we cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , it &apos;s from the water .
professor <unk> walter &apos;s university in alaska has traveled with another group to another <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
she &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat is <unk> greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level is rising by <unk> , it <unk> it into the sea .
these rivers take fast .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that came over a couple of <unk> is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , they see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people on the world get half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the <unk> , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if they &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also going to <unk> most drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in sierra leone was seen .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
these <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have got to be in a really <unk> , and had never been <unk> before .
four times a lot in the last 30 years like the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 , all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent western and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there is a <unk> decline in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build lots of other <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken out in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last <unk> to apply clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
in christmas , around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this was about christmas .
one of the ads of the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will be clean every day .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear way . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change has been started in life .
this is one , part of her .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we put it to the top <unk> , spend a significant <unk> to bring a <unk> on the way to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave that to you .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of the main reasons for global warming is that the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here changes everything .
look at that right , this is the most modern , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red <unk> that all together is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , to make us safer , and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty <unk> , that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
<unk> america : it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you , to get the time of your childhood , when they played with <unk> .
while they realized how to reach out and <unk> the hands , taking the <unk> and moving , they actually learned to think and do problems with understanding and change <unk> connections .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore the answer , and we developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : they &apos;re physically , why you can only move them like <unk> to reach out of the hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a consciousness for their movements , see each other , see each other and see the <unk> of our <unk> with you , then we can start to explore new and <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is <unk> , and if i <unk> it into a direction , the video is going forward , if i <unk> it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them next to you , that makes your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and movements .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color so , how to do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we <unk> it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there are also some nice possibilities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and the results want to see immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci number i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of time on every <unk> letter , and as you try to form words , these are tested over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s <unk> , and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some children who came to a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and try it and put a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; make words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> on the bottom on the right .
it turns out he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters in the scene by <unk> the <unk> from the table that shows this character .
this is what he &apos;s making the sun .
the sun goes .
now he &apos;s catching a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> and put them next to it , he can interact the characters .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and he can decide how to develop .
flying cat .
the last example i have today to show it is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes into the sequence that you can put in any pattern again .
and you <unk> them by just holding a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect him with a certain sound , and then it tends to hire him .
and then more than larger effects like speed and volume , you &apos;re doing the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start where we <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> and organize them in a series , extend it , and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something <unk> .
and now i put the filters with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can speed the whole sequence by <unk> the speed in one or other .
and now i put the filter still with the bass ; some more expression .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s going on .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the <unk> , but can improvise ; they &apos;re expanding or <unk> .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by running the <unk> on the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which are better to fit in how our brains and body work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you with the way is that we are on the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to digital media , the information in our world , which is the demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very excited to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit busy with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking for a few years with the <unk> , and that &apos;s what i started to know , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it even in terms of what i &apos;ve learned in the study of theory .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to kind of get closer to the matter , like that .
i think the molecular biology in general is talking quite general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important and still much , much more important in the future .
there are so <unk> things like these entire <unk> plants changed on the <unk> .
there is now craig venter in the <unk> , trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
and then there are things that are totally out in the everyday life , which most people are not aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash with 40 degrees of laundry , and also <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from the interest of this on this technology , i &apos;m just going to go on to the <unk> .
so what is a <unk> ?
most people know most people know that from the <unk> .
computers , and then the media will always be like that , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws out somewhere , and so on .
it &apos;s kind of very sad for the <unk> because it doesn &apos;t really do what it really started like , and what &apos;s actually behind .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about making a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and it &apos;s been able to grow with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that do all sorts of <unk> things .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can use it , and you can also <unk> it , so , and i found that i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
this actually took <unk> eight really shape , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s originally from switzerland , that &apos;s with europe and with a cooperation in india &apos;s <unk> network , but now , members or active people all over the world .
but it &apos;s actually always about finding this kind of <unk> access to have a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more such a forum where where you can wait and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then there &apos;s also such a way to ask <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that made the whole popular process , it &apos;s kind of developed as a scene that i &apos;d like to <unk> for a short time .
here in the picture on the left , you see <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , such a private school , nonprofit society institution , where everybody can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go around , just to <unk> them , they put a lab and look at what you can do if these <unk> .
here on the left is a group in indonesia , <unk> , which is , you know , there &apos;s quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
they also engage in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in a pretty <unk> way .
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition at the theme .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s the most young people , but the only thing that really is the one , is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it and just ask and ask to society , so , okay , what do you know what you want to do , are you interested in putting you in this ?
so , okay , so to make biology , you need some kind of material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you usually understand under a lab , these are kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely <unk> , just for <unk> , trained academics with ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each each one of every <unk> has actually evolved technology than most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really like this .
and oh , with this premise of this premise , for example , brian <unk> in england , <unk> a <unk> , has then taken a <unk> , a <unk> and , yeah , so <unk> , and then he has <unk> bacteria .
so everyone , who &apos;s already a soup of soup , which he has left too long , also made it .
i &apos;ve tried it in my lab home , trying to scale a little bit , and then i bought so <unk> on ebay and made a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so it &apos;s like this / <unk> <unk> , again , home .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this yes , such a kind of <unk> in the principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so there are people who are doing it at home , so much larger organizations , so that the more <unk> are already doing in <unk> form .
and , you know , that &apos;s why , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation , our basis ?
and there we have , then , <unk> a <unk> .
this was pretty intuitive , so everybody has just the wishes of his wishes , his and the what it &apos;s moving , then , then .
there , i think , was done a very good code .
and we don &apos;t have that , but that &apos;s yeah , i think it &apos;s pretty good , and people are quite convinced in this .
and we actually tried to get it back into the academic world , but there &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> in terms of even further than the academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects are we going to do now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to make a so-called optical trap or optical <unk> .
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the laser , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
so another project , from the french group there from paris , that worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s like , you know , such a <unk> , such a <unk> or something like that , so he &apos;s busy with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then put this one helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , that went .
and then the visitors in the room could go in the room , put on this chair , put this helmet on .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , they &apos;re then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , replicate , <unk> , fragments , so you can make them visible .
and the machines that make something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy commercial , the cheapest go to <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
i think , somehow , six hundred dollars or something .
but in any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
a project that i had started recently was building a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , it &apos;s about so far , two inches or so .
you invites <unk> to <unk> and then the <unk> in these <unk> , and then i took it on <unk> , and then they put it on the light .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , which looked pretty wild , like this one branch , the thing on , <unk> electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> and i put it on .
a <unk> , if you have the full power of water , it has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s so 40 to the <unk> bar about it .
and so you can speed the particles strong enough , and then they go into the <unk> .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros or something like that , <unk> around the 50 .
so , it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically possible .
so , that &apos;s the moment that the <unk> of the scene is , to increase this availability of technology and also increasing the information and the <unk> that more people can be engaged in there .
because , as the beginning is , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to make it really good .
because , if you read just about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it even again or seen .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make good decisions in society as well as a society in society , you want to be able to join , and then you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you need to do it too , and understand to do it and understand it .
and this is then <unk> under the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so , as a citizens , you &apos;re <unk> to the situation with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting , also , is that they are also represented in southeast asia .
this is i think that &apos;s there are less people , as actually exist .
so i know about some of you who don &apos;t have <unk> .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
partly with these <unk> , these places have been put together .
and this is all in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has just started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are represented everywhere in the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to hold ourselves similar , and then we &apos;re also very good connected , so that the time can be more <unk> .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and also try and try it myself .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get far too .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we work in people ?
this is a question that is very moving to me as a designer , but also in the area of the <unk> , and in front of all things in the area of user <unk> .
it &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and create a very <unk> experience .
i think that the interactive media are <unk> into us , cognitive models , so paradigm , which have been <unk> in our biological memory of very , very long time , and that we can create the only through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you really believe that these <unk> , you know , that you actually bring it into the future , but in fact , the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
so what are <unk> models now ?
i &apos;d cut down four <unk> , and i want to explain to you short .
to <unk> cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve done in the <unk> times .
in these <unk> models , we have basically natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds basically unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;m going to prove to you by trying that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since because of these <unk> models , we &apos;ve been able to do very , very , very <unk> , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language today .
and the third area , which explains actually itself .
we all know that the interactive media are <unk> by definition , which contains the denial of sound , and of course we say that we feel the sound today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
how is this with the physics that is actually the most fundamental thing in the world .
i want to prove that to you .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and happens right now .
they go into the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they <unk> the reality and it &apos;s no computer .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we give us hard to show the virtual reality in our <unk> , so we can actually do that all the time .
and this fortune to <unk> the virtual reality , which has needed people in the <unk> times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , memory was playing .
in this head , knowledge became <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination , was also passed away .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can handle this as well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can do a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what it is .
the interesting thing about this is that , at this time , the person was <unk> and medium .
now , if you think about a piece of pieces .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about again .
the <unk> tool of the <unk> have been about stories .
<unk> , priest , so-called <unk> , were extra <unk> to preserve knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still hanging out very , very strong about stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to us , we still have a year of <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child who has spent it until the one of the <unk> who spent most of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on that we were sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s much further back , in the cultures of the <unk> times .
but for me , in the area of interactive media as particularly impressive , that we have <unk> per se in our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i brought them an example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , somehow , to come from island to island to get food .
and they did this with something called the <unk> .
you may know that , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit , of the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used that <unk> or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be recorded about songs .
which was the language of <unk> <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and over rhythm .
and these sounds and that rhythm have shown the <unk> , the topography of a region , and of course it &apos;s allowed you to be able to <unk> these songs and do it differently , and go back to the right and also move back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing that to come from the top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what has happened there ?
this is what happens to this <unk> machine age .
we &apos;ve moved before in what &apos;s called the <unk> .
what happens is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve changed the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories in external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so we unfortunately have a piece of god <unk> .
synesthesia is suddenly alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
from the <unk> to the machine age .
what has influence on our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> influence of the original cultures are .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> in the course of the centuries of the <unk> .
that is , instead of remind us , we have standardized , far common , common pattern of memories , where we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more .
we have an abstract <unk> language .
we don &apos;t ask us the thing more in pictures of things not more in images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to doing things linear .
and we accepted the sound as law , and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what is coming now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re going to go down this called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very well for science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , they bring us these options to discover our skills again .
it &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain a little bit to this .
there are technical concepts like the <unk> reality , which means the extended reality .
so crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , we can move physically in not existing , virtual worlds , all the way to the model of the <unk> .
and other example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being smart .
all that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;m hoping , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can get up for a moment , so you can talk to the two of the two about the project .
and i brought this project to me as an example of how again in this <unk> , cognitive models will be <unk> .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
which of course the <unk> is extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people in front of some people are <unk> , or that they play with any <unk> in the hand .
in any case , they do it in .
this is a game for outside .
and this is specifically thinking that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data of the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i have to <unk> so much .
you can explain that a lot better , there &apos;s more and more more behind .
and that &apos;s what i discover a city by looking at which places have been positive or negative .
and so i get a whole different view of the city , a very different sense , which i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get this kind of way , a very different , virtual map from a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is still a little explanation from what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world is living in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with them .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is there to be a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to me instead .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s in there .
but now i &apos;m just doing it , and i &apos;m going to make it a little bit curious .
yes , kids are curious or should be curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a designer of house , so i also work with the topic of curiosity , and how do the curiosity change our thinking , and why don &apos;t we lose curiosity , and we need to <unk> it again and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re working on next to the actual existence as a designer .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in this n of <unk> .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half a year .
a <unk> to the subject of natural user interface design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why do the whole designer of this natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and i just hold one of these little devices high , because things are going to be more intuitive , always natural , <unk> , and there you have to look at it , which is , of course , people , of course , what is <unk> or intuitive .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing what , of course , or intuitive .
maybe again , you have to look back .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , in short , we &apos;re now moving from the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern in to the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning of the <unk> with the language .
this is , you found that you &apos;ve talked a common language , you could communicate with each other , it &apos;s moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities have formed or villages , and it has created so <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
so you had to learn , so no <unk> can talk about nature , but we learn it from <unk> and <unk> of course .
this was then <unk> through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language began to <unk> in the form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive , i start to start and <unk> it in stone , and that &apos;s how i <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s , of course , a very different story than if there &apos;s one alive .
but <unk> then <unk> this writing as a <unk> , got a <unk> .
then the next generation , where we &apos;re actually , actually , mostly life .
this is just the pressure and the <unk> <unk> writing with <unk> and other .
at the time , it was the same kind of <unk> where <unk> , <unk> and other people said , are you really insane when the people start reading , then the later <unk> , and that &apos;s completely <unk> .
and of course , that confused us , of course , because we see on one side the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
and these two worlds are just opening up , new and old .
the exciting thing is , if you look at the guy , this new society , this <unk> , it <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the topic of ecology is a global global .
not , if i think local , and the neighbor thinks less green , the whole thing doesn &apos;t work anymore .
this is , from the local village , actually a global village has become a global village , very , of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village , who has something to who and when , that &apos;s what happens today , about this extension of our self through these mobile <unk> on global level .
it &apos;s that we know , we know global <unk> and more faster and better .
that &apos;s how it happened to the village as well .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been busy looking at it , which means it &apos;s actually , what is , of course , what we may have <unk> , which is also instinctively , so what does the difference do ?
because often people , they can &apos;t do it , so everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not just make it change that it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
you &apos;re going to be engaged , also , as a student , with the topic of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you start and look and look and say , okay , now i just look at the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
so how do we work if we <unk> ?
and what does mean , of course , , intuitive , and how work our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs has said , you know , you have a <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the detail when i want to make something <unk> or intuitive , which means that in the core .
and looking at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many of them use the word , but don &apos;t know what it &apos;s called the same detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understand when the information becomes information , when the data comes out of information and information , again , i know how i can actually do things as well and , of course , <unk> .
and of course , like design influence on perception .
so very much natural , which is in a vessel , but i look right , where is salt and pepper in there .
and if i say somebody , let me give you salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to think of it in the right , where is what in there .
and then , in the left , just intuitive access and i hope that no sugar is in there , giving the salt out .
but also our perception itself , how do you make it too .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just so big , and yet our perception is depending on what context we &apos;re doing .
anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should be working .
there it is , in my glasses , more .
so it &apos;s &apos; n .
a second circle starts to connect , certain similarities , or <unk> .
this is what you call <unk> or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
important for the designers , they have the most first <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> near , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
so often in the third third , we forget .
but this is a essential important component , if you want to make things like this very , very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision .
sounds very trivial , but it &apos;s so exciting , if you &apos;re closer to this .
so we have the eyes in the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the front of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back to the front .
because they <unk> a assumption to the front that they see something that they recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re just going to see our vision before we see it back to the back in our <unk> to say , okay .
i have this <unk> cognitive <unk> , you have what you want , what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also there , then that &apos;s coming back .
then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not going to the front and says , well , actually , i &apos;m going to look at it again and sure , if you see what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , like certain things are going and what &apos;s going on for <unk> , these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now everyone is trying to see something like this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who you can see .
anybody see something particular ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that , that there is a <unk> in there , then you know this .
you &apos;re never going to forget that , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , now you &apos;re always seeing it .
this is , i &apos;ve actually <unk> them now that they don &apos;t recognize more patterns , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> within a very short time , to see this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of seeing , <unk> , looking .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the front that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes , then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here , in this <unk> mass , it &apos;s very <unk> .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i sort of the present in the <unk> , then i can also bridge it to be very good , in which i &apos;m going to do with three seconds .
it &apos;s got to process it as present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can <unk> very elegant <unk> , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what is <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love .
that means , look , if you know this , you look at what you look like long , because i don &apos;t take a <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen right now .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptions we have .
that means this first impression happens in a fast fast speed of how we perceive things .
and how we see things , what we &apos;re looking for , and how we &apos;re also going to protect us against our environment , so that we can think about this .
of course , the designers don &apos;t just engage with the topic of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but of course , of course , with the topic of the <unk> .
so , how a person is going to a certain kind of stuff .
there &apos;s once <unk> the practical functions , so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly , where do i actually have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why are somebody for such a little <unk> where no one of the <unk> , so <unk> <unk> of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are , rather , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we also think of as a designer of course .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the topic , which , of course , also <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> always means , how can i be able to achieve a certain goal , or how can a user in a certain <unk> can be effectively effective , efficient and <unk> .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i make something very <unk> ?
can i use that directly or need i , &quot; n manual or need to have a <unk> training . &quot;
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i do it just differently , and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
it &apos;s an intuitive <unk> , not only since apple , a fundamental <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i want to make a technical tool for the people .
why ?
because in the rule , we are through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , for example , five times faster in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make something of the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you will probably go back home for four hours , but your employer or anybody , you know , is a way to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that for us , of course , it &apos;s a <unk> , also to make certain things .
if we go back to the area of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> interface , which were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , the next <unk> model or mental model like the software <unk> , worked , because you would have a idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
that &apos;s what the whole thing has done , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;ve made a lot of the behavior as a designer of the behavior as it looks .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i think that it always looks like a <unk> for success , just the <unk> will be a app .
and if i put a step in this natural user interface , where i have a voice , by language , by <unk> , by the gesture , and not more by mouse and <unk> , you need to control things , then i &apos;m even faster and again .
but , again , that leads me to the point , when will the things be more intuitive ?
if they &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look , what does it mean from the view of the <unk> , when is it really intuitive ?
and this is , for us , people are always intuitive , if i have to think a little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s very easy to do .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we look at our existing <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a designer .
this is , i can put a intuitive , human <unk> on a software , and i can make the software a lot of <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is the kind of <unk> <unk> of us people , and now i &apos;ve already told it .
this is the so-called <unk> .
this uses every one of us and <unk> is an acronym , and it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , informed , <unk> .
this makes each of you all the time , but he makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s basically intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is already going to be <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without that most of us already knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> will be about 50 to the <unk> of us ever for activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often than the day .
i can now <unk> this mental <unk> , <unk> , informed , <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar as the metaphor of the <unk> , now not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> metaphor .
then i can transmit the whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
you know , everybody has eaten every cake .
<unk> : now i &apos;m going to <unk> with the object , can <unk> again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole picture , can now filter this , and can say , just show me all the thing with chocolate .
and again , one interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so all of those who are here and curious are , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk about that , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they give the + you give scale to about two gram of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two gram of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only <unk> as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we did not take phosphorus and give it an phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re going to deal with something , which would be actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not like that .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus , and already , through the <unk> world , a lot more uranium in the environment is used as in all the <unk> .
alone in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium in our fields have been distributed in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , <unk> less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , just beat three times , instead five .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our whole earth will be used or later a <unk> .
just to think about the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the <unk> is stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons per acres or <unk> .
that means we lose more in the ground about five times more than new educated .
we can , of course , look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> are <unk> .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the <unk> are going to be bigger .
that &apos;s them , sort of , all in the <unk> .
yeah ?
one baby needs about six thousand <unk> .
we could , of course , reduce that to 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this will be balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being <unk> with the pigs to get the solid components of it .
the people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , right ?
traditionally we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you get the people that if you exist to the people , if you say , it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , says there &apos;s nothing to stabilize than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you get a human life , you <unk> the earth .
here it says the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we people .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody may see termites , in so far , although they &apos;re <unk> .
that means the ants weigh much more than we are .
and because they are physically working much harder than we and because they live only three to six months , they are in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree ?
yeah ?
one single ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be <unk> than trees , yes ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
fortunately , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> on trees .
there are still six billion trees in the <unk> .
you &apos;ve heard about it a little bit of <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be <unk> than trees .
and where you see , even in something like <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , it doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back into cycles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that means we feel so guilty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all call it that allow our own <unk> to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , in terms of <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , the highest , not there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil in where we get the nutrients .
right directly , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china to example where we &apos;re taking the waste out of it .
in china , a <unk> is still <unk> , so , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to get our nutrients back .
this is , the whole western <unk> <unk> that the city has always been taken , but the farmers never got a bit back .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities had to continue to get their nutrients .
all the western rich are always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five thousand years because you were always able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you invited to eat in china , you expect to eat it as long as you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , how you can get the nutrients back .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas is back about 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be a little bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is <unk> , of course , but the plants are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can just manage it .
that means the <unk> will go back .
and no of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been <unk> .
they could just <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want , you write up , in germany , at the best way from all the <unk> , that &apos;s in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> a little bit .
because the <unk> plant could actually get the phosphorus back at the best .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it really works .
we &apos;ve used in holland for three years .
the dutch government has explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need the total .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and the oil will replace us by other energy energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
this is not about making the existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , what is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , of course you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if your wife is sad when you &apos;ve got them , and you come with 50 <unk> .
completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eating about six <unk> three kilograms during their life .
in this .
this is not scientifically accurate because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be .
but a <unk> , even in these lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , yes ?
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not <unk> , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn the <unk> a little bit better and do it with it and to lose all the materials for the loop , but first to ask , how do you make cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yeah ?
if i <unk> them to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot;
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yeah ?
that means everything that counts in life is not to save , avoid , reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say to people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , the throw is exactly the right , yes ?
every place you go , from , yes , you create <unk> .
but the wrong stuff .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
as we think from north .
there &apos;s every footprint on the <unk> .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s going to destroy the ground .
because the ground is going to die from the mosses , and the wind and the water washing the ground away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , each one means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , <unk> , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow of the car <unk> out of the car .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> system , which is in room temperature , a liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build up everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so they contribute through the throw in biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so , there are two cycles .
not all is supposed to be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they just use them , they don &apos;t use them .
only the things , the <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they need to be that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only used are going to technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
very direct advertising , not for the company <unk> by se , but for that you &apos;re helping this company to do these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do the things more free .
yeah ?
so , if i <unk> them to eat and say , this is free of <unk> , then you can &apos;t help them .
no , we put in what &apos;s in there .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic water in .
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the <unk> on the <unk> , and the <unk> can go in biological cycles , yes ?
all of this is <unk> of it .
and if we do , of course , we &apos;re going to work for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole industry industry .
and this is half of all the <unk> around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help them , ask them to people .
hey , <unk> , do you really be serious ?
because they &apos;ve now changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not so sure you &apos;re really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that &apos;s what it is .
we can now do things so that if you <unk> , if you <unk> , you can get into biological cycles .
technical cycles are just like that .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , in fact , that &apos;s made to go back into the cycle .
also that , so in every store you can <unk> the things .
if you come to this , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> of the <unk> ?
if in the moment , the garbage is .
all of these <unk> are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there it is on the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
yeah ?
alone , if you take these these <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and the powder , to plant trees .
so the baby is <unk> for the whole life , already from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can still invent everything .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working with it , and you can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra association to do , <unk> , where everybody can join .
so no more saving , <unk> , avoid , reduce , no <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , it &apos;s written that i , as a <unk> , can understand me as a <unk> , so in english <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of the written notes in <unk> music .
now to translate from german to english , it can require more knowledge , because if you go to poetry or it &apos;s all about poetry .
it &apos;s quite alien , but it &apos;s for <unk> , what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i just first got the written notes .
they &apos;re sure that the composer has been <unk> in the notes of everything he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same or the <unk> , like a <unk> , if also very seemingly <unk> , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the <unk> just to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
this is , the agreement has to translate this <unk> to the <unk> in another , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
today i want to translate to you what i could translate to music , so <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of the translation .
so i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it again to english , it would be surprising to me with translation of the translation of the translation .
so , the music works for me as similar as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to learn just to learn just notes , and the keys on the piano or the right place on a <unk> .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of the letters is only when you can do the language .
so you need to have the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , only passive , or you can talk active until the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts like the one <unk> .
after you chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited , you &apos;re going to <unk> in the origin of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers itself .
you study the work he made before and after .
you represent comparison .
the <unk> , the <unk> , to write .
how and what did he feel ?
how were the circumstances of the society and the politics ?
all of this is interested .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but with the time , you also have a rich knowledge for the composer that you play with more times , and it &apos;s going to be more easier to feel and feel in him .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend which you live together .
his cause to write the piece is always becoming more and more to my personal cause to play .
because now the notes are all other than an accurate record of the composer of the composer , but just a framework , i &apos;m going to turn this framework to <unk> it again with sense and meaning .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> , which could mean these notes .
now for me and for the composers , and what you could mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense of it because i feel it , because it comes from my now personal <unk> .
it has to be for me in here and now <unk> , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve developed so long in advance , to experience the new .
how to live a happy new day , although always with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , work , so i also have the same piece back to the new .
i &apos;ve become a day older to change seasons , my pulse goes down at night than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer that the sound takes back back than home .
i take the breath of the audience , aware or unconsciously .
all of this affects me , and all that affects my experience with the composition .
so wonderful is , if i stand with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and there &apos;s a answer to this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things happen we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t see .
it makes great fun to make music in this way , and they as the audience have seen how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , like in this moment .
i can &apos;t play this way today as in 20 years .
there i &apos;m going to have more experience experience than today , and so i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> in my palette , on emotions and emotion , than today .
sure , i &apos;m also going to have some <unk> , but for a new <unk> .
i have a nice physical example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> to my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great luck to meet him very early , with 13 years old , and i was in my high school in my classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses again and played the last of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> is for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
there he was <unk> , and he said , right ?
that has to be the <unk> .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , with 17 , you have even dreams , but no important memories .
i play the piece every few years again , and it &apos;s always changed for me , although no only note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
one example of a very different area . <unk> made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she looked at this moment in this moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is like this .
now i &apos;m also older than chopin , with <unk> years , when he wrote the piece .
he was living just <unk> years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even if i mean , you can <unk> them .
to keep <unk> , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection right to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need to take for about the same time for the spoken language .
often the <unk> is that you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning reading before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes to the notes on the instrument .
if all the finger in time and right like it is moving in the notes , then the notes come out that sound like music .
if the <unk> happens , the students get the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not talking about interpretation in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s the front line , which is a quick piece .
<unk> , slow .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s most familiar .
but also , if you put that data out , it still remains something technical .
and yet , it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget about <unk> .
because it &apos;s to make music on the instrument , doing their own musical , and feel right before .
that &apos;s what the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not do it by itself .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experience and idea of music , then to bring it over another way , about an instrument to make sound .
people who never sing , so they never felt directly with the own body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
and the instrument of music is the extension of our body .
our vocal voice to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s going to be boring .
no more need to whistle or singing a <unk> .
every music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re going to be <unk> with music all the time .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing it ?
the question i can &apos;t sing you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if you can &apos;t yet can , or learn how to hire these little muscles that put the vocal voice , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it to tell you that they &apos;re <unk> .
so , i ask , how <unk> competent , was this diagnosis ?
have you got a <unk> or a <unk> , how to say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to have a failure to do it .
but what i would have regret is because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you see , all of the cases no one has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand about the classic music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there i say , but sure you can say whether it likes you or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t stop food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give up to classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them and say if it tastes or not .
whether the music is to you , or too cute .
tell what they feel .
in the time , they &apos;re also going to take standards , and you want a little bit more <unk> , or taste fine differences .
why do i challenge from my audience now that it &apos;s also going to listen to active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of art you never look at has no force .
the food that became cooking by a chef or a chef and a chef , and it has to be eaten , and not only looked or recipes .
so , please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in a environment where the adult is doing active music or at least active music , it &apos;s growing a child , then it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you now play me in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was the first first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written in a hundred , <unk> , or three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have <unk> .
there was no piano to the time at the time .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited when he had the <unk> possibilities of today &apos;s modern <unk> .
i can have the <unk> that the stream had to sound on the modern wings , which can &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
also , by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has rejected an orchestra as a <unk> .
that &apos;s why the composers rely on us <unk> that invent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> , which you &apos;ve just imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what the heart is ?
have you been <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a <unk> .
if i come , with my little v <unk> and me next , this feeling comes up .
i &apos;ll shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need this n of big car ?
it &apos;s lost half of his value in the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford my n of little car ?
and then i immediately fall out , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is away .
our organism invented a great method to make these uncomfortable feelings like envy .
you can do that also with words like revenge or <unk> or something .
i want to explain something about this mechanism today or something that &apos;s probably unconscious .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them .
one of the lie is that the liars even don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to check that he has a whole different .
he &apos;s just <unk> them and not itself .
no , the lie that i talk about is doing it , that they deceive themselves .
they need this lie , to get a <unk> to get a <unk> upright .
they can bring them less easy , yes , <unk> or <unk> .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you may know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once has a woman <unk> .
this woman has then <unk> , the portrait would not be seen .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be more similar .
in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time they need to learn something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to a lie .
the artist shares them something , and especially this lady , which you don &apos;t see , if you just look in the mirror .
the artist shares them in a portrait of what they &apos;re going to be familiar with , if you look at this piece of art again .
then this awkward feeling , it may not look similar to you , and it will always be more similar to them .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories it comes back .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility of this real <unk> , and the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this real <unk> .
but we should just be familiar with a woman to say that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here it is necessary , which is what we understand under <unk> <unk> , and again .
we need this lie to this lie that <unk> us , without which we can &apos;t survive .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art , in the <unk> , but also in science such great lies .
and there is this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the ancestry of people .
that the person should be <unk> by the monkeys and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she <unk> her to her man and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles there writes out . &quot;
the person should have <unk> or a common ancestors .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent the people to get out of it .
why do we need to prevent people to get out of something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live with these <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t <unk> these things .
we need to prevent the people to know about things , especially when they are true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism looks like the traces , and how the traces <unk> , which leads to something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to share another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife has told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told them about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to love him because he has a tendency to <unk> .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s nothing wrong .
i said my wife , whenever a person in a moral <unk> is using the <unk> because we should try to replace it by the <unk> .
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they feel that this is the real truth behind the <unk> .
this is a little <unk> , but it &apos;s not interested in the <unk> .
that &apos;s interested in the <unk> .
but there are no clubs , which we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
there he was signed up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t tell his teacher that you like to put fire somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire <unk> .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re in charge to remove the dangers that others can do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> , knew he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
so then we just create these words , which we also use in the language of the politically correct <unk> .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know when we say that , the social relationships are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that should work .
i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , these <unk> , the willingness , another reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
so i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is going ahead , what many of you know and some of you appreciate that a few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so much intellectual , says about darwin .
and from this soul , they think that they somehow , in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , is called it in the latin , the <unk> , present .
and if this <unk> is then <unk> about the people , then he &apos;s filled with mind , with mind , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that should be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic , which we experience this happiness , through a lie of our world to improve .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
this is now a <unk> that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need something logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because to lie , you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences come before .
the first sentence is , <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , he has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was particularly <unk> with him .
a third sentence , which immediately shows in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , it &apos;s dead , and it can &apos;t argue anything .
and here you are .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , these are logical correct .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t talk about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have the right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s true .
i can argue everything .
but key , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence already proven and assumed .
because actually we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , that just uses two sentences to be correct , and a third <unk> that looks like this , as if he would have something to do with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we do , as if it &apos;s actually impossible to can live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things on different examples .
in the present , in the present , we have a very modern example , which is over and over again , the <unk> .
so you have to have another <unk> topic , a <unk> from the philosophy , present .
and that has to do with it that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> , which was called <unk> <unk> , and after that , the <unk> <unk> named .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you place the exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what <unk> he should go .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the <unk> are introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you bring another example , so if you immediately make the one bit bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing .
it automatically goes to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , from the larger pile that you have immediately , you also have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re also in <unk> in <unk> , i remember the <unk> for brain science .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which is called a wolf , and he says , sometimes , wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence , and can say if wolf is right , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the newspaper , that &apos;s what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , can &apos;t be <unk> for his actions and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s so <unk> .
again , they have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of first sentence is wrong , as you need to take the opposite without evidence .
and now , you can just do it if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to do people happy , practice that courage to lie .
practice this for example , if you see a human being , then you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please , you don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call them , this would be a little political .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately you will have one , for granted , you have these <unk> , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy , you know , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled her .
because he led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t stop themselves .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in being <unk> to the need of evidence to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the kind of shift in the <unk> , you experience the <unk> of the lie .
and if you have a way again to feel this <unk> in other people , do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember that way in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed me to wonder if i can mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and she asked me whether i wanted to keep a talk here and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it was hard to talk about my idea at first .
and i might like to imagine my <unk> that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
and i came up with the middle of the <unk> years to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were all <unk> at the time , the <unk> was called <unk> .
the name is <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either built or <unk> .
but something like &apos; n <unk> , from the kind of a hundred watts from the square meter out , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> grateful that he <unk> the word again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
however , it wasn &apos;t like that in the <unk> years .
there was so much that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in the <unk> where you gave the evil .
place of <unk> , but that was called <unk> , and has made wind and solar energy , and there i started in the middle of the 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very concerned with me because many , many beautiful expressions of what i &apos;ve also been through .
i worked in the collective for 11 years , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s busy with <unk> .
and i got it to <unk> <unk> , and then we got together with friends , i &apos;ve become <unk> of the company , which then together with the <unk> <unk> of one of the largest <unk> in the world .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to come to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where could you use a memory of a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people .
they have a renewables today of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> , the system starts to fail .
i always tell politicians when they <unk> our facility in <unk> .
they always say , why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island there .
the question was simple , the <unk> that was <unk> , the first contacts with the island started , look just through .
how big would you have to be like a battery , so you have a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe <unk> percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year of a hundred <unk> electric performance on <unk> <unk> on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very quickly everywhere .
the world &apos;s <unk> of the world , which is happening , is wiped out , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you think of it as a box .
and then it looks like this .
in that , always three of the <unk> , two will always wait .
yeah , this is what one of the bottom is just the load .
we also get very accurate data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system that can only <unk> in small amounts here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
the <unk> is going to be <unk> and the wind , sun , the load of the load , that you can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go about 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the <unk> .
this is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables are sort of able to take the entire net .
you can just be able to , of course , if you &apos;re able to do it in any way in some way .
that &apos;s not what any one has done in the world .
this is in little style , so you can use your <unk> on a little <unk> car .
people always ask me , what are you doing in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to <unk> several of these <unk> , and you should build a net , it &apos;s going to be very complicated .
this is going to be a fuel energy , the then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or <unk> , it will be .
they need to go more to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know , what is a normal , <unk> battery .
how far can you get there ?
and then they did a whole lot of simulation .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , like the <unk> , if the <unk> is up five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would all have to be done ?
have to negotiate with investors , i was looking for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to build one in the society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , is that we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of <unk> and also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island has meant that we find this great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of build the electric terms of the island of the island of one to three .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , it &apos;s been <unk> to the bbc , today &apos;s <unk> , and then it became <unk> to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
she &apos;s got a megawatts of performance , and it can bring six hours to this performance , and this is the battery that we have , sort of , <unk> <unk> .
and then they set it up .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the wires , to kind of represent the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see that again , again , the <unk> , here again , the whole , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since <unk> was the hall then done , until today , it &apos;s sort of <unk> everything that was there between the individual system of electronics , software , we made it .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define us as a company that is only between the topic of battery and the subject net and everything in between .
you need to communicate , of course , to the battery , you have to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is that , in this island , you &apos;re basically taking all the <unk> to the problems we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is the moment back and <unk> , <unk> , as it should go , on the island , we have <unk> to 30 percent of <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is then providing <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start on the island already , to integrate <unk> , <unk> , because you can manage the load .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can <unk> through the n of <unk> , you can do it by <unk> , yes , you should do it in every case , the percentage of <unk> , but you can never get up to memory .
and that &apos;s the n of the message .
so many people come and look at this , just because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the <unk> , then you don &apos;t have the <unk> mass that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just from a <unk> mass of big electricity , where always the wave is like around europe .
we look in this web , see the 50 <unk> , and if it &apos;s going to be <unk> nine <unk> , we &apos;ll start a couple of <unk> <unk> , and then again , a little bit of <unk> steam , then we come back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you <unk> that somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in the time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , these spinning mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> two milliseconds of battery to this big battery .
so , you can see what enormous <unk> there are .
and the message is , we need to get up to these rotating masses , if we sort of have our goals 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach that .
then we need to break our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> is easy , the power plant is running to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> because we don &apos;t otherwise , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and we just try to tell you that you can break down the capacity , the <unk> capacity , to break down , by getting <unk> memory into the net .
so , fortunately , there is also a whole lot of studies .
and at that purpose , people always come and look at our <unk> , like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you make a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years .
doesn &apos;t go , is <unk> , <unk> , we have all <unk> , don &apos;t see .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out that , in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity at <unk> store in the world .
very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been experiencing , basically , in the last two years , that the scientists are putting themselves on my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million <unk> now , also , to <unk> the <unk> net now to the german net .
that &apos;s going to happen in april .
so , you can also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and only from this <unk> to yes , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
we &apos;ve always tried to make these <unk> , these <unk> , they have a little net , it has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is , but it &apos;s very simple , if you make themselves completely independent , of some fossil , or <unk> <unk> , who are going to be <unk> somewhere around the world and become <unk> to you , then you &apos;re an island .
then they just use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said they &apos;re using solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in this way , the talk of <unk> <unk> is that you can use a collective and you can use solar energy , here &apos;s a little together .
and yes , i want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve <unk> , <unk> of los angeles times , one day by the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , playing on a violin , which had only two strings .
nathaniel left <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless man at the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the <unk> disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he talked to a very <unk> and <unk> sound on <unk> <unk> and hillary clinton and about how the warrior would never create it in the baseball world <unk> , and that all because of the <unk> passage of the first violin , in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to the subject of music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which <unk> was interested in <unk> .
i have to mention that blocks have been <unk> medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has followed his whole life .
and in exactly such a <unk> , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in the <unk> disney hall , and he had lost this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked completely .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke and about how somebody wanted to poison somebody in the sleep .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i realized that in <unk> eyes , a complete change was going on .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical response that was <unk> my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing some clips of <unk> , and then asked me to end them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , started from stream on beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a <unk> knowledge about music , but with her also a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i could only know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by talking to music and talking about music , it was from this <unk> , <unk> man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for <unk> , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him , his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> state .
i understood that this is the creature of art .
this is the reason we make music : so we have something that is in us all , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is that all of us , and moves , inspired and united .
what nathaniel <unk> , so he brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel music , whether in the <unk> disney hall or <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i got a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen to do the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was <unk> in <unk> after the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could probably feel to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the boss of the company asked and asked if i could give a event to a event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this incredible problem has become for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we have <unk> the ocean as we beat forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
it &apos;s almost nothing more .
so it will be <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . it &apos;s a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
this is , 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company , trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the boss &apos;s boss for the company .
let &apos;s call it &quot; don . &quot;
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out of the ocean that you don &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we are basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one what ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t i , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a <unk> answer , until i finally got to the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not , because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is me even .
no , i &apos;ve actually <unk> <unk> from this fish because , i swear to god that <unk> fish after this conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i ate him first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came to the table with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
remarkably , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good after it became <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on what was basically the <unk> .
they did that by <unk> the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they <unk> water out of the country and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and green was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought green the country .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company , the ecological destruction completely reverse .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and this density , green march .
i was not a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part , &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the <unk> and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> keeps a <unk> .
here he comes up with a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of <unk> .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of <unk> that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> spent the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and it falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , like that .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak over this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there is no food .
ever heard of a farm that didn &apos;t feed their animals ?
at the moment , it was like a director of a <unk> would require a <unk> .
and we <unk> around the corner , and we offered the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> , a literally pinker carpet so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
she &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well , last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private <unk> in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> , not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the <unk> .
so the <unk> of the belly is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , these <unk> of state should not even be there .
they breed in a city , 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night , they &apos;re flying over 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced me a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , are you flying back to the farm , and then you fly there for 240 miles back at night ?
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was just <unk> a song from the whitney remote .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to try it in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t taste it at <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last <unk> before something to go into the body .
it &apos;s evolved in the course of evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added on , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have a <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that measures their success , the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no <unk> , he <unk> it , because the water that goes through this farm comes from the river <unk> .
it &apos;s a river that leads all of the things that are rivers today , tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves is the water clean than how it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water .
because if the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should do that , because this love story , like romantic always , is also <unk> .
you could say that she &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , actually taste good .
but for many people that &apos;s a little bit to radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we are lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that tell the future good food , someone somewhere around and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not , because we have already produced enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> <unk> in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have defined the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
<unk> grain in <unk> , <unk> to the earth , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and the whole time it has just been asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can this be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the <unk> . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that <unk> fast capital capital , which allows this production to be .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by the fertile country , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , but not by <unk> and nets , but by fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never has something really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that <unk> on two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
companies that are not worlds for themselves , companies that are <unk> rather than <unk> , companies that grow <unk> rather than only intense , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , you are a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain cause , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are the most active and they &apos;re over here at the <unk> .
we can move a step further , and we line the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we move on and after age , we say 40 years or younger , we see accidents are the main cause of which people should worry .
and who &apos;s going to see that this is especially true of men .
so you can see that the view of information and data in this way is reminded of swimming in a living <unk> .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not the content itself ?
what we &apos;ve now got here are the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; who &apos;s ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you like to test it after my talk in their <unk> .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong <unk> , so i click on this , and i &apos;m going to show all of my spending in which <unk> armstrong will mention .
now , if i want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the topic of <unk> ? &quot;
so i go back and i <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to choose or <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit further with something that &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and reduce it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short picture and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia at the most popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i chose &apos; government , i know that the <unk> that are most about the time of <unk> &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a insight that is not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back a step and look at the whole .
looking at a certain of these summaries , i can go into the topic of time <unk> &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everybody together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are <unk> . some of the science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and throw a look at all ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re doing the first time the first time it &apos;s really a net , not only from side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else is what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step , and go directly to a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s important because you just look at the view of websites in this way , all the <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in to my course in a certain time period .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration that i gave up to this .
and i can sort of see everything i &apos;ve looked at today , <unk> .
and if i look back and look at everything , i can put my course new , maybe after my <unk> , here , i went to &quot; <unk> , &quot; here to <unk> , or here to live labs .
and from here i can go into the side and call it back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes big bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the curse of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking from drowning in information .
if we can do that , then this past <unk> is going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know knowledge , we may even get <unk> out of it .
so i hear a lot . thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> part of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school with the bus to school every day a hour per road .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> that <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , and in a <unk> way , my deep <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible exploration .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques <unk> came into our living room with his amazing shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder we could never imagine before .
that would be very good at that <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s neither video games to these <unk> with <unk> films still had the whole painting in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all have that . if we read a book when we were children , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> them on the canvas in our heads .
my reaction to this was to draw and paint from aliens , aliens worlds , robots , <unk> and all that kind of thing .
in the <unk> , i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i was hiding in the <unk> textbook , <unk> .
the creativity had to be kind of out .
and something interesting happened . which was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly i would never do a alien world with a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on the earth , and she was so fascinating and exotic like all the things i had ever introduced to me when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i decided to become diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me <unk> .
i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , found , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool in the middle of the winter in <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , it &apos;s a real ocean , i only got two years later on face when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , in the past 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under water , and 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , very opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love for the ocean is holding up with the same intensity than ever .
when i got a job as a adult , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images , to unite .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so on .
so films were the way to bring images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i <unk> from the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could connect my preference for the <unk> and the diving with the <unk> .
so basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create such a kind of liquid <unk> -- that we took on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what came out of this was the first <unk> <unk> that ever saw in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t make any money , and he just played his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like <unk> from the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur <unk> &apos;s law , <unk> technology and magic don &apos;t be different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that has to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; <unk> 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very much on how this effect would come .
and it worked . we had created something magical . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we had a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a very new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> at the time . she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the idea of this company was to skip the stage of analog processes to visual <unk> , etc . , to start with digital <unk> .
and we also did that , and we made a benefit to us as a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we actually started the company -- to slow down .
but the bar <unk> very beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do that .
so i moved this and made this other movie about the big ship , the <unk> .
the <unk> was sold as &quot; <unk> and julia on a ship . &quot; it was a <unk> scale of magnitude , a passionate film .
but basically , i wanted to go to the real <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we come to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i convinced you to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that that the own imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , in a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really <unk> me .
and the risk of that was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things .
and i fell down , like very , very <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up into this capsule , you &apos;re floating down into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is in saving , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that would not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
so that got me right , and i wanted more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the <unk> , and we explored with <unk> .
we turned back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , that <unk> a <unk> .
our purpose was , <unk> and look at the inner of the ship , which has never been done before .
nobody had explored the inner of the <unk> . you didn &apos;t have the tools . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and look at the <unk> that these <unk> are pretty similar to this , and i know that once the band played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> by the <unk> of the ship .
i just <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically there in the <unk> of the titanic .
so the set was an accurate copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this <unk> that you use such a <unk> , and so your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a small view of what might happen in some decades , if you &apos;ve got <unk> to explore or do other things , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started to learn what we had seen there , really estimate , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help by <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a <unk> system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was again the <unk> of my childhood .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went out that i took the <unk> with us into the deep sea .
and we made a <unk> , but actually science , in fact , said , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , at the time , as a child , and the manifestation of reality .
in the course of this journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i think you certainly have to think , a director has to lead , a leader , like a <unk> or something .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the <unk> . it &apos;s not a trace .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve got all these films , this dome , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the alarm you have from each other , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you respected his team and make itself in the return of its respect .
it really changed the dynamic .
so , i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain . we made &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were going to be a right family for a period of four and a half .
it changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who thought we would have <unk> these <unk> and transported to the planet <unk> .
for me , it was more a <unk> way of doing my job , the real process that changed in the result .
so what can we get out of all of this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the alarm of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmaker who says , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
that &apos;s the other one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and study , failure needs to be an alternative , because there is a <unk> .
no important effort , the innovation called innovation , has been seen without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
this is the thought i want to give you with the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my <unk> at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make the things we invent and provide to allow the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years . it will rain too much or too little rain . the things will change as it can &apos;t be their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the <unk> of them is very important .
in fact , if you could just reduce the price of one thing , it would be energy at far to the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like the time .
in fact , the <unk> of the <unk> is based .
the <unk> drove the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we meet a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 kills the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually pretty clear .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> , and where their other consequences are , there are some <unk> , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly <unk> about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> minutes , &quot; do we really need to come down to close zero ?
isn &apos;t half the half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a <unk> truck that has to go under a three feet bridge , and you can sort of <unk> it .
this is going to have to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
everybody americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that reduce that to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly up .
only different economic changes has been influenced at all , and we need to reduce the rise to the rise to a reduction and a reduction to zero .
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people live .
and it looks at nine billion <unk> that are moving to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could probably reduce that to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that &apos;s all , the food we eat , clothes , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means to make these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
here we see a very fundamental service . are there home light so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , by other <unk> , through new ways in the <unk> , there are many services , their energy , some of the individual services , we &apos;re going to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like the manufacturing of <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> : <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , the window for improvements is very much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction in a factor three or maybe a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it turns out the question is whether to get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every <unk> of electricity today is co2 , except renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonder .
usually , there &apos;s no <unk> that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just going wrong and some come , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked me , how can i really bring this out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that <unk> the idea of people here ?
i reminded me last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow people liked that .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they all don &apos;t bring a lot .
we need solutions , either one or several of those who have an extraordinary scale and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many directions in which people are looking for it , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve gone out of the tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
who can guarantee something , which literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard problem .
next , <unk> .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
i put the last three of the five .
it &apos;s renewable energy , as they &apos;re often called .
and they have -- even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some <unk> .
one is the energy energy that these technologies make dramatically lower than the power of electricity .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power plant .
also , these sources are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always get all the time .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way , the energy also in times if it &apos;s not available .
so there are big <unk> . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t need just the technology , they need to deal with the risk that the energy from where else comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to give these <unk> sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the world .
if you want to support 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
well , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so many of you will say , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are many who are already involved .
bill big has multiple companies , under other companies , has the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies that do great things and have interesting possibilities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company , which , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts lie around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium will use gradually a little bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of column that &apos;s often called the <unk> wave reactor .
that really does solve the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that is burned on today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you get <unk> and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should we look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many are talking about an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture . hopefully <unk> and concrete will be clean to it .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , have completely changed their <unk> .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key feature of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 look like this ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reduction on the way . the less we <unk> , the lower the <unk> will be , and also the temperature .
we need to track these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure that : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy <unk> , &quot; the hot air .
they really go through and create a framework in which this can be talked about , because we need support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very important wish that we invent this technology .
this has the largest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
for what things do i do ?
we need to use for more research programs .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous low funds that are spent on these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to be <unk> and full of dialogue and also the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> , another billion , the <unk> and the place that actually build the first one .
once the first one is done , when he &apos;s going to go like this , it &apos;s all clear , because the profit , the energy energy , is so different than you know , as we know it .
to understand that right : that means deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear <unk> , this <unk> , and then the process starts up , and is still working on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . today , you have to get the reactor always new , so there are many people and a lot of controls that can go wrong . this thing you open it to open and <unk> stuff or <unk> . that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think about a column that buried it without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> who offers a solution to the trash .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the waste : you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it into the next reactor and you burn it .
and we start by taking the trash , which already exists , that lies in this <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so this is what a problem was a problem , which is what we fill in our own , and that &apos;s going to reduce the <unk> dramatically during this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked about different people of this world over these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest in what really really is ?
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a version of a thing that was made .
this is a important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who has done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , <unk> and probability really is to call something in life ?
<unk> : well we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years .
this is basically the <unk> that has shown us the <unk> that we need to <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is going well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , which , as if their approaches work , that works for their pilots to do that .
and it would be best if it could create several , because then you could use a mixture .
in any case , we need a solution .
about the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest one you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
it would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know the work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems hard to seem to be , but maybe you can say that about us .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we need <unk> , to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come to this situation , it &apos;s like you have to eat too much , and it &apos;s a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is dealing with different techniques to <unk> warming , so that we would have 20 or 30 years longer to get us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance because you might do something , so you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that one is going to save the <unk> .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for the one to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptic is living in very different camps .
the ones that make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can say at all , from which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is as similar as aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than you do today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
underneath , other things should not suffer .
you come to big <unk> , and here you can disagree with reasonable people when you have something that &apos;s not economically , and try to fund that , and for me , most of the waste happens .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> and fund just the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the <unk> you get , a very high <unk> , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing the lifestyle .
for the lower two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research talk more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s bringing the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little that will support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all people here when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you , thank you .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> had a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to build the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti sauce , about three feet , about three feet , and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s going to take people working very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
usually , most people start to <unk> themselves in the task .
you talk about it , you think about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they <unk> and put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> structures .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time more , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it carefully on the top , step back , and &quot; <unk> , &quot; you admire your work .
but then what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> does that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
there are a series of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; and under the best are fresh <unk> of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the children invest time in the boss of the spaghetti of the spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different about it is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they have a lot of ways to fix <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt , kids get directly feedback what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance , with prototypes to work , is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers create something more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to build stable structures .
ceo is about average . but here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
put a <unk> <unk> on the team , they &apos;re going to be much better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and this team , the <unk> and the work , is going to improve the performance of the team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six who have stable structures .
i tried something exciting now .
i thought , we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> .
so i offered a <unk> price of software for the winner .
what do you think it happened to these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone had built a <unk> construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we did this practice with the same students .
what do you think it happened ?
now they understood the advantage of the <unk> .
so from the same , bad team one , under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or <unk> , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
and those of you who care , can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples from all the world , how people <unk> and <unk> the system .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , how our feelings and our do , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that needs to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to bring to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do that as we would have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i ask me what they would choose because i have asked my friends in last time the question , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america addiction the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of <unk> to <unk> .
and i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that you &apos;ve ever been on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time before these .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents were <unk> this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there should be better a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . the smallpox had killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of earth in a way , like no war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , disease , the millions of us have only been threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method , to try and look at whether it works , change it , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t disappear from this chaos , we &apos;re also going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country you live , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i really think that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me wake up at night -- one of the things that i &apos;ll wake up at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it reasonable , as we can today .
people are <unk> in their faith , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is free to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to think , even a right to his opinion of progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; &quot; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i needed a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to make resistance , to resistance , to what the end of the most effective activity in health care is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and i went on .
and soon i wrote an article about <unk> food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i was writing a article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were on a certain kind of random kind of <unk> that was a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we type , we rich , we go food , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> , who made me crazy at all , were not <unk> .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that brought me so mess .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we are at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as well .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we talk ironic about little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons are that .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , there are no reason why that should not be that way .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons of weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were always right . so be skeptical .
imagine asking you , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything as given .
but now it &apos;s : if you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that from the reason we live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which brought the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in connection .
very scary .
tons of studies have been done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we believe , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
catastrophic , because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is down for <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
because does someone get <unk> here ?
does a single one in the audience ever see someone dying of <unk> ?
not very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but <unk> times over the world in the last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death through <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like jenny <unk> can walk around and put messages from fear and <unk> of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a <unk> with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul talks and talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people just should stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell without armed <unk> .
he gets calls home at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them away , go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we &apos;ve been <unk> in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children are going to die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in <unk> .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me wrote a few weeks ago , and i said you believe i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody has ever said that before .
she would not <unk> her child against <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe tomorrow , someone in lagos has a airplane and flies just to los angeles , at the moment it &apos;s over ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> today .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if he &apos;s not .
we love to stand up in lying . we love that .
did you all take their vitamins today ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you <unk> .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference how often we figure out that they &apos;re useless .
the data shows it all the time .
they <unk> their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> itself to us that can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away , and where do we go ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to do it .
and i have all sorts of little <unk> here .
none of these -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people shout to me and say , &quot; what does it care ? let the people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some <unk> that want to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where faith and magic replace evidence and science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of people , because he was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than <unk> drugs that we know that they can stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> death in a country that will be worse than each other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
well , the <unk> epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this ridiculous fight between the <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . she has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch of <unk> , every <unk> , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11 years .
and some of it works , and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;re <unk> , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re <unk> <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear always is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all that is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real <unk> , and it keeps millions of people from <unk> .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that eats half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and would not become blind .
they wouldn &apos;t be hungry , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , we ask us , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about gene <unk> . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> here , it &apos;s about getting people in life , and it &apos;s going to get the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so on how far , we &apos;re going to do something that we think that i don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of us , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might like to say , &quot; you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and the future ? &quot;
all right . i want to do that every case .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up in the time machine and we &apos;re going to go to the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is to me , that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
a deception is going to be something true , because someone &apos;s feeling it like that .
so to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s , in every <unk> for children .
i even learned it from the <unk> <unk> magic <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hand .
i push my nose back .
and to make sure that nothing in my nose disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to <unk> my wrist here .
in this way , you can see that not time moves anything . as long as i get here , nothing can go into my nose or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the knife will <unk> through my naked physical magnetism .
it actually sits so clear to his place that i can shake it without that the knife will fall .
nothing goes into my nose , or comes out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often get to little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , although it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
probably many of you here in the room know this trick .
it works like this .
i think the knife is in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing in my nose disappears or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that it &apos;s the actual secret of the illusion .
in the moment , where i <unk> my hand , so you see them from the back , this finger is moving here , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position in which he &apos;s so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone sitting in the back , who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> , the finger changes his position .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s all about here . and then i open my hand .
of course , it will hold there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing is , by <unk> me , is hidden through this movement that the finger <unk> .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does it have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really <unk> me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
so it turns out , if you offer a <unk> to a white pill , in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape where you give the resistance , for example , to change a smaller pill , and color this blue and shape a letter to this , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although no one of them <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me crazy .
but it turns out that this is not all .
if you take <unk> , they &apos;re even more effective than pills .
a colored capsule that &apos;s at the end of the end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
it &apos;s also a role that makes a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , ...
... also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you put into a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem so good like the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem so good like a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem so good as the needle .
and nothing of it has some really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our belief that in us can make a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obvious to be a deception , and let it look real .
we know from this study that you have to reach to the needle if it should go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long <unk> . she &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of it .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin and put them through it until she <unk> on the other side .
if you &apos;re bad -- if you &apos;re easy to <unk> -- i showed that a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman has become almost <unk> .
so i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re <unk> quickly , you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first <unk> part here .
you can see it the same , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now a little bit of my skin and on the other side is so back .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the <unk> .
about that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> itself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show it to you .
how does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people back in the back says , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are now coming in .
let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can <unk> it .
sorry . if you get bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
usually i would take the needle away .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no injuries .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m just going to let the needle go there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re very happy . thank you .
everybody talks today about happiness today .
i have a few people count the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive <unk> , which kind of makes it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act of these cognitive fall .
this is for <unk> , which is thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just so confused as any other .
the first of these fall is a <unk> , complexity <unk> .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning on which we could limited it , but in big and all the things we have to give up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy being in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the sad fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without the meaning of it .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and then he added , really pretty emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it <unk> was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was <unk> with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what it really says is that we could think about us and over other people in the senses of two species of itself .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now if i put them here ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and <unk> the two , is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we make us tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experience , is a story .
and let &apos;s start <unk> with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who have a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . she &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to share their pain all 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of two has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a is a much worse <unk> on the <unk> than patient b .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one that was worse was where the pain was at the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing in the whole ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a as a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the <unk> self , b clearly had a worse time .
this will lead the patient suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
what does a story draw ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory gives us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
which is a story of <unk> , <unk> , significant moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end is <unk> .
well , the <unk> self lives its lives continuously .
it has moments of the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you somehow get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of the <unk> is our life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re on this world .
and as we use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really pretty different .
the biggest difference between them is the deal of time .
from the <unk> self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly as good as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
so that doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation is hardly better than the <unk> vacation , because there are no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self from a <unk> self . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experience .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which sort of <unk> the <unk> self through experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> self .
i have the impression that if we do vacation that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re going to <unk> holiday in the service of the <unk> self .
and that &apos;s a little difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that for the dominance of the <unk> itself is given .
and i probably have from my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are only a year and a half hours .
there it seems to be a dissonance .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all your images are <unk> , and you get a <unk> drug , so you &apos;re not going to remember it .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
why we choose the <unk> that we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two types of itself .
well , the two species of itself throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea from the happiness of the <unk> self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s how happy or pleased the person is when this person thinks about her life .
very different term .
everybody who doesn &apos;t make these terms is the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , which <unk> the exploration of happiness long , on exactly this way .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and happiness of the <unk> self has been recognized in the last years , and now you &apos;re going to have to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson we have , i think , learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a impression of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i say somebody &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what happiness &apos;s happiness is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means mostly to be satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of itself , you will do very different things at the end .
the conclusion from what i said here is that we really don &apos;t want to imagine happiness as a <unk> for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think people have to be happier in california if you say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and this difference is we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could pull out at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who move to california in hope , to be happier .
well , your <unk> self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you will think that you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to remember how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think of well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we were talking about a few weeks ago , they mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting result , which came from this <unk> survey .
is this something that you can share with us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness of the <unk> itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly happy , the poorer they are .
that &apos;s where we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money does not raise a <unk> , but the lack of money is certainly <unk> , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to make everything on the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , in general , would take a <unk> like the seriously , and would make policy based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it gives recognition for the role of the <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
people are aware that they should think about happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
as you can increase happiness , it &apos;s very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , they were <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics are .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should at least be the most exciting political debate about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane <unk> . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to do it as easy to save the world in reality , how to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , more time with playing bigger and <unk> games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i calculated that the needed time , at 21 billion hours a week , it &apos;s <unk> .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty precisely why i think games are so vital for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he built a camera before the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you can get some of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , very <unk> in the solve of a really difficult problem .
if you play , you see some <unk> here , which are up to the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . nice . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so very positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you get it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do something like this . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just standing before a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces on the world , if we take the barriers to the next century , the face of people who are on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we tend to see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better at play than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s heard .
we get more in <unk> . i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration with each other .
and in reality , if we fail , when we come to obstacles we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they don &apos;t have them .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , to think , you could not just reach everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that are going to be able to do the epic <unk> in <unk> .
so , first , if you go into one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are ready to <unk> you a <unk> mission and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so they create this .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , so they have to work . but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you turn <unk> . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish up your epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in the true life , that feeling that in a <unk> bunch of employees , we &apos;re ready to stand .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have heard of &quot; level high , &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + 1 : talk and a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in the true life .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at any time on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we prefer to spend our whole time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> had spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go upright .
so the first <unk> primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play , it only makes sense , when you think about the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that , by using this whole time to play , we actually change what we are as people .
we develop to collaborative thinking , thank you very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s what i think .
look at this interesting statistics that recently was published by a researchers of carnegie mellon university : the average young man from today in a country with strong <unk> spends 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st of age .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours are the exact <unk> that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the high school of high school -- if you never miss .
so , we have a complete <unk> on the young people to learn what it means to be a good player , like everything you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know the theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of any subject to the 21st of age , we will be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing what the most important people in the world are .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players of <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we would never have had a human potential for it .
so many people are now in the world that spend at least an hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> , the <unk> , are saving energy and working on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , with players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is what these games are doing .
here are the four things i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , a barrier to the master , together with the belief that we have a <unk> hope on success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying , and it &apos;s the same .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after we played with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone &apos;s game .
we trust that someone has time with us that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same goal and to stay in the <unk> .
so the <unk> can grow the growth of bonds , trust and each .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> play 22 hours a week , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard as if we relax or do nothing .
we know that we &apos;re going to work as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it , part of the awe of <unk> missions to be <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to go back to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in every other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who lead to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individual .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he &apos;s studying why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to witness not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit <unk> .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in <unk> than in the real life .
they can make stronger social connections than in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s totally logical that players are going to spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just have a voice , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that <unk> 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> , there were <unk> .
and these were the first of people to developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek <unk> <unk> , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the <unk> , games , more <unk> , were invented in the kingdom of <unk> .
we thought there was such a great famine that the king of <unk> decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , and on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and surrounded us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived so 18 years for this famine , eating on a day and playing the next day .
so , i think we &apos;re going to put games today .
we put games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we put games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in the real life , and we get us what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better , so the king , the last <unk> <unk> decided .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a <unk> , and the results were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and did the search for a new home , and they just had so many people back , how there were food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of a area where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , who started the roman empire , has the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently come to the notion that <unk> &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> , which took almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could agree .
maybe they actually saved her people through play , by having 18 years of games in games , and then they had these <unk> , and so much about the play , they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 warcraft .
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they were playing <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be <unk> that half of us spend an hour per day with play until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and that &apos;s the question i have dedicated my work in the last years at the institute for the future .
we have this flag in our office in <unk> <unk> , it <unk> how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then people want to allow people to do this idea in reality .
we &apos;re asking us <unk> <unk> , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very short three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people <unk> <unk> in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 . and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years since .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have <unk> the behavior in the game .
so we &apos;ve put a bigger , higher goal for the next <unk> game as just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
starting to start is the computation of a <unk> that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call of players , <unk> , we made almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s the &quot; <unk> , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only together , you can save the world .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we get on the third of march : it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end the game , you get the world bank award , &quot; social <unk> , &quot; by 2010 .
we work with universities in very sub-saharan africa , and we invite them to learn social development .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and genius .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , who benefit from their own social companies to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you something .
what , you think , happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope that you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all <unk> , <unk> productivity , the ability to make tight social nets , <unk> , and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play serious games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you will design to play with me and play .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things that we can create every <unk> future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that i noticed a few months ago in writing a article for <unk> wired .
i &apos;ve always finished writing my <unk> , but i was finished with the <unk> of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been to my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read them the post .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started to build with elementary school and started building my self <unk> outside my family , and form , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god , thank you , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at the time .
would i take this point seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person , whose life can be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately asked me the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected me to make a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words are <unk> under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the <unk> , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big force because what you &apos;re going to do loud is <unk> .
so , what do we really want to <unk> -- a disabled people or a powerful person ?
just to call a man <unk> as a child , it could be enough , they <unk> , and they might <unk> them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you doors ?
a man who opened the doors to me was my pediatrician &apos;s <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t say correct , so he was always called dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> always had very colorful flies , and was just created for the work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
and imagine , i even did a child with dr. <unk> , and i tried to stop that practice , <unk> without success .
and if you create it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i ask me today , how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls have shaped my sense of self , and i could imagine to see me as one of nature to strong , powerful and <unk> human .
this is just one example of many , how adults can transform the imagination of a child .
but as the <unk> examples prove to the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we would all want us to see : to allow every single person to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were caused in many cases by a technological change .
so maybe this technological change is clear because ever that there was always a different truth , which is that every person of society can give a very <unk> and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course we &apos;re <unk> from the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to <unk> to come up with our lives better .
<unk> are just in our lives .
and i &apos;m running out to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s always in me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the effect of the impact or the severe of the <unk> of a human .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> , and every person is different about it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come up with the <unk> or not , but how we can see it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for protecting the people we love , <unk> , but they also prepare for it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be one of the medical fact , a <unk> and to the other of the social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to put up with me is that the world is constantly thinking , she can describe me with these definitions .
maybe the current concept , which is just to look at what is broken , and how we fix it , for every single person a bigger disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t treat a human and not perceive all its forces and opportunities and recognize it , we create in addition to the natural fight , which you might have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not <unk> these <unk> times or <unk> , we should not try to avoid it , we should return them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about seeing the <unk> opportunity .
it might be more important to me that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but that we are open for it , to hug them , to put them on the <unk> to use a <unk> and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can create it , <unk> as a kind of natural , <unk> and useful , and we don &apos;t feel like that through their presence as much as that .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , <unk> on something very true in human character .
i would make it so <unk> : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the <unk> of his kind , but the that changes best .
from conflict , creativity is coming .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , the fight of the human mind , is determined to turn to conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re going to do , if we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of <unk> , a perception of the self , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are on a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s say , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really want to learn this poor , gray person , if they really would have it ?
i think it &apos;s not .
<unk> found that we have people from the members of our society , always , to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals of 60,000 years ago , older people and people had signed up with heavy physical injuries , and that might happen because the life experience in the <unk> of these people was valuable .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone , in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there before a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee <unk> . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i got them from the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it took click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i knew only from narratives of my mother about this day , because i , of course , very typical , came to my birthday two weeks too late .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> of my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were <unk> after you , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to be the bad news .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical that factor can be for the quality of people .
see , dr. <unk> changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone is dealing with it , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking in the course of time , if you would have asked me at the age of 15 , whether i had my prostheses against legs from meat and bones , then i would have no second .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is happening because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened the doors , rather than to meet people who were <unk> and wanted to be a idea .
see , it really needs a human being shown to you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own , inner forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you open a door , then you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open themselves doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , <unk> the potential .
again , what potential we want we to do now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , a case case was done , and then <unk> turned into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are <unk> to notes .
and the a student will be tested in <unk> , and the better teachers get more and so forth .
they then gave up to a <unk> student with a &quot; enough &quot; the note &quot; very well . &quot; it was told to you that they were very smart , and after these three months , they actually wrote <unk> .
and of course , it took one of the heart to hear that vice versa , the <unk> said , they &apos;re just enough .
and then it was then after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- apart from the students who had <unk> school .
and the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that the <unk> and these are the students with the grade enough , and so they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that was broken , no hope , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more <unk> of our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability of imagination .
but if we can do it to support the human mind , continue to hope , even and other people around us , to find out , curious and <unk> , then we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , through a few changes of their genes , could have better memory -- more precise , more specific and faster .
or you want to be <unk> , stronger , more force .
would you like to become more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always <unk> for more creativity .
which one would you like ?
which one would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as the creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose to decide for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to <unk> , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all a <unk> ?
or is it possible maybe ?
evolution is a <unk> topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor to the theme .
the big <unk> in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian <unk> church , wrote a paper with the title &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this : is it just over the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it <unk> , or is it too much to us ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we are most interested in .
we <unk> from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , there might be 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the life of life , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty same .
is it clear that we can pull it out and make the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is <unk> <unk> from what &apos;s coming out of the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , are you aware that every one of us in our gut is getting more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times a lot .
i mean , think if antonio <unk> asks for your sense of self , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you could just wish without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help by <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we determined to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment better ?
in this huge <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is just short in the world ; the animal kingdom , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s us .
this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope that d ate it like .
now , when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i asked , something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , every cell <unk> , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue in both <unk> .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms came up , the things started to change .
sexual reproduction is in the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction that <unk> the genome , the rest of the body is <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of our body is going to the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who was reading his show in the &apos; 90s in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup .
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal in the other way as the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health after a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from a evolutionary point of view , they and i evolved as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to fall into the ocean .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood , the <unk> of all the expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to reach it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be <unk> the largest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , that are <unk> , and if fish would survive there , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum of <unk> fish on the consequence , yet they managed to make a <unk> environment .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons for this is that it was first of medicine , we managed to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and were removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we have our environment so <unk> that we did it that they adapt to us right and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we travel and run and mix up so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution , to <unk> .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional way , of course , <unk> from the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of the evolution are slow down slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is , if we are <unk> as a species , it will give <unk> and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and decided to make us as <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child but also to make the body genetic adaptation that would cure and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or the reduce of the risk of risk or <unk> ?
would you not want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can get a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long , until the reality is going to be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available for everybody .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that is produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection of themselves , but also to serve the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine against flu that has been grown into the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , a lot more can be possible .
so imagine just two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the <unk> and the <unk> or the fresh <unk> egg to give your kids a better chance for a <unk> life -- <unk> the diabetes , <unk> the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can allow the change to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> that are going to allow you to walk faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the qualities we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that is going to require 100,000 years , and we can <unk> it in a thousand years -- and maybe even at the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be able to deal with it .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful that is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different qualities that we want to have for some of us , and not for other people ?
are we going to be a society of <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to meet .
and at the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in good , like in evil , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another , that helps you to get up and go back .
we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and that will increase their speed and help them keep their balance .
that &apos;s actually the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- to combine and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who are wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human human universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , many hours .
his flexible design allows it to be deep down , <unk> and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then increase my strength and resilience .
we are far , with our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our look at the <unk> , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , which , in the <unk> of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- from fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number is multiplied .
and so pretty the only option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or about other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been about 500 years since he has to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility in mobility .
so let me introduce you to <unk> , which is carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> for 19 years ago that has no longer run for 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is attached to your back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hip , and also like their <unk> , they move forward in this pretty <unk> and very natural process .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> during a <unk> <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not for a long time , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been <unk> me since to learn to go back to climb , and even drive with the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the <unk> , but for everybody .
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m a boss of the <unk> of a nonprofit organization called robin <unk> .
if i don &apos;t get to poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteers , <unk> the fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , in the volunteers , you have to have a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to get <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the <unk> , so i had quite good opportunities in it .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> and barefoot under a screen out in the <unk> rain while her house was flames .
the other volunteer that came out of me -- let &apos;s call it <unk> luther -- got the <unk> as first and became asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who , for the rest of his life , could tell people that he went to a <unk> house to save a living creature , only because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me up .
he said , &quot; <unk> , you need to go into the house .
you have to go up , on the fire , and you have to get this woman to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear .
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back down , where i met my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our values out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention got than my .
a few weeks later , the <unk> received a letter of the <unk> , where they <unk> for the brave use of saving their house .
one of all the measurements of kindness : somebody had even brought her a couple of shoes .
both in my job in robin <unk> as well as a volunteers fireman , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the act of charity and the <unk> of individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at it in this room and see people who have either achieved a <unk> success , or on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life of another until you get your first million .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
use them in a <unk> , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we &apos;re going to offer a chance to save the life of a human , but every day we give the opportunity to change one .
so they put up ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s <unk> .
a place where the women lead the <unk> with sex , hello , &quot; and the game determines -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your <unk> .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are led by large , fear of <unk> guys , the <unk> of <unk> females are led .
they really came up with something , because this leads to a very <unk> society , in the deadly violence now .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they live in the deep <unk> of the <unk> , and the observation is only hard .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the location of a violent argument that has been <unk> for decades and almost so many lives , like the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also threatened the survival of bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> lead that you could not even fill a <unk> with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees <unk> .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead war , &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules like conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobo &apos;s life is more than more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , it &apos;s really essential to play for the attachment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
that &apos;s what we learn and the rules of the game .
game increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and of rituals .
play is the <unk> , which is <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and male in a <unk> .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
just i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah .
so <unk> are spread , both in bonobos , as well as people .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think , just like you play alone , and we <unk> borders of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and the unexpected <unk> that we form are the real <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights , the bonobos give us our past and present .
but they also really have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges , through bigger creativity and <unk> to cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , game is our <unk> .
to adapt successful at a <unk> world , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people are equally , life doesn &apos;t exist from teeth and claws alone .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem <unk> , play may be the <unk> .
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and play together while we get the creativity to the <unk> and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , middle 1979 , at the same day , in the same moment , every <unk> of a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> because , if you imagine the whole time , you won &apos;t listen .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case the <unk> is wearing a y <unk> that hits the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the <unk> is wearing a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people .
at most of my activities , i have two <unk> .
under a hat , i work with the story of anatomy .
i studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people <unk> with anatomy -- that means human body , animal body -- how they <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about body .
the other hat i was wearing in my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as a <unk> lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often i worked with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the kinds of <unk> who are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> that we all have at the stage of <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the <unk> in the <unk> stage testosterone gives you .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a consequence , the body evolved more of the typical female course .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes most of the time to puberty and grow their breasts , and develop , but not to get their period until someone comes to this , that this is something different .
and they make a couple of tests and find out that they instead have <unk> and womb , in reality , and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which is <unk> hormones .
most women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we talk to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was more <unk> than a woman who was born with <unk> and has a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be distributed over the whole bandwidth .
he had an extreme form of a <unk> <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> was so powerful that they basically created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male turned out , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody could see something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he <unk> up , that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes develop something called the <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> twins , is it <unk> -- and surgeons often are adapted to the norm , not because this would be for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they are often made different kinds of surgical interventions are because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain <unk> scale goes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a female identity ; to be a black person , means that we should have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
and if we are faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture about <unk> .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender has been asked at the <unk> world war in berlin .
many journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what test are you going to do to tell us if <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature doesn &apos;t pull the line between male and female , or between male and <unk> and female and <unk> ; <unk> are we the ones that say that line of course .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
in our observation , we get into all sorts of <unk> areas .
we go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we are only different from a few <unk> ?
as we continue to move our science further , we are increasingly in a zone of the <unk> , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we had probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas where we see this for the <unk> , in our today culture , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body for people , so that he has another right than the <unk> life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have never been so hard to fight when somebody was dead .
they only gave someone a spring under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if they didn &apos;t move more , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we take people to <unk> organs and want to put them into other people .
and as a result , we <unk> to the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have more so simple categories like it .
now you could suppose that the whole collapse of categories like me would really make me happy .
i &apos;m political , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , it makes me deeply .
and it makes me <unk> in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i first have to pick up that i &apos;m a big fan of the <unk> .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in what they did , i &apos;m going to look at all the few years to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> happened to the <unk> .
the <unk> were the original <unk> activists , so that &apos;s why .
what she <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for a <unk> .
as you all remember , our <unk> <unk> the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy had been based on a very <unk> concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power was to have this political power , because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to father to son and so on .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> this idea and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were created with the same .
they <unk> the field of play and decided that <unk> , the common <unk> , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they did that , because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things were <unk> .
democracy grew up , but at the same time the science was growing .
if you look at the story of the <unk> , the lot of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , and <unk> things , like a <unk> concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made a concept that was about <unk> common .
and in a really wonderful way , they prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
and women <unk> that successful .
next , the successful civil rights movement came where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin color , which are <unk> to <unk> similarities , <unk> differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start to look at all the common similarities , we need to start to ask why we maintain certain <unk> .
well , <unk> , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish to the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to give their consent to sex or married .
so there are some <unk> <unk> that make sense of me , and we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both middle 1979 <unk> at the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of you , maria , three months of <unk> was born , so she was born on june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , is born to the <unk> , so he &apos;s born on a march 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria three months of <unk> was born , they get all sorts of right three months before <unk> -- the right <unk> sex , to choose the right to drink the right .
<unk> must wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find other <unk> about what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now be moved , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
mary , but it can &apos;t be the same right in all states , the <unk> in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
<unk> can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are problematic and <unk> in many ways .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science is doing such progress in the area of anatomy , that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going on itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to pull a line , so we &apos;re going to pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to marry a man that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and marry a woman that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the <unk> of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we should not take people to &quot; their skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you measure people because of their <unk> ?
i want to say that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships as some <unk> i know .
so how do we take the question of the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and a part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be made in the future -- using an mri visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make ideas about questions of democracy .
in our effort to make democracy , we made our thing really good , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
states of these kinds of species exist in us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked to a few years ago that had a few <unk> twins with himself to separate them , partly to make a name .
i said to him , &quot; well , do you have to think of political <unk> instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are without changing the state of will .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities like democracy , or looked at , if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that is radically radical , and i think that there could be different kinds of insights that are <unk> from different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people apply a <unk> .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i also was interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not each , but in average -- more often complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation to us .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , i asked one of my <unk> who knew my interest on feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it &apos;s still -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the ultimate question i &apos;ve ever heard .
<unk> , it &apos;s about stereotypes about gender , that &apos;s why feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , and so more , i thought , there could be something <unk> on feminism .
this is supposed to be , it could give something , on average , what female brains are different from male brains , which makes us <unk> for <unk> social relationships , and to worry about the <unk> .
and maybe it &apos;s what we need to go in the future when we take democracy over anatomy -- less about the individual body , thinking about identity , and thinking more about relationships .
so that if we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it , to every opportunity to find a different kind of <unk> , crazy <unk> , and to photograph and photograph in the last time and blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also to my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars are used for a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; and it makes a very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i filled with this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
i brought back seven some <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i made sure that i wanted to have everything i wanted to wear , if i just came to palm springs .
and because you &apos;ve not heard of me than the woman who &apos;s walking around ted in your underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i really want to show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you also some of the lessons that i think or not have learned from these <unk> , to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole thing , including the coat , has cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost essential to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you put other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will totally be <unk> .
i spent a lot of time my life to try and be myself , and adapt to myself at the same time .
be just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i saw , as if i &apos;m <unk> , or i remember her <unk> .
i like to smile and i like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , then it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for you .
if you believe that you are inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : developing a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without saying a word .
it &apos;s been proven to me over and over again , if in this week , people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate everything again .
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things emotionally , because the same in the corner , there will always be another crazy , <unk> , <unk> <unk> that only wait for me , if i have a little love in the heart and looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call the lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
a few time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula for a race , then they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
these would call them , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start coming up in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been equipped with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and as the computer in the free , you start to respond to other ways , you &apos;re being seen and driven .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they are 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this perceive and driving in objects of the daily life .
this is from an exhibition , the preparation for moma later in the year , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , begin to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom there will be out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes radical the interaction that we have people with our environment out .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of <unk> ...
now , today , our environment begins to get to answers to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of seeing our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to introduce you is in truth one of the first of our labs .
it came from four and a half years ago in italy .
the summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was as italy won the <unk> .
some of you will remember it was in italy against france , and then the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy won &apos;t win .
now , look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the <unk> in the middle , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , make the calls and move .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
<unk> , people do a short call , go to the toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal <unk> .
first , <unk> , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big <unk> .
the next day , all the center went to the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all the down .
you see the picture of the space of <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the <unk> at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
just a different example of feeling : here it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips from which a mac computer is made of how they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where the things go .
so , in this project , we &apos;ve actually designed some small markers to track the waste while he &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have helped us , a few more than a year , in seattle , helped the things that they <unk> -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , <unk> on the garbage and start tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw , not just disappears , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we would show that to people , we can push a behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> who came to us and said that spain and the <unk> have a beautiful tradition , to use public places as part of architecture as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were <unk> on with a <unk> was , imagine these tubes , and valves , <unk> , work that open and close .
they make it like a <unk> with a <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall down , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to let them go out , how you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it really liked him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the entrance to design the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it &apos;s going to open up and let them go .
the roof was covered in water as well .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to reduce the <unk> , you can even get the roof down .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s happening in the inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night as all the sensors stopped working .
but in this night , it was a more bigger fun .
all children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to let you , but a building that had still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump right now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the nice thing to create things that are used and interacting with the people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> from water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter flying through the air , and each of you with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , that moves with others , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or <unk> in three dimensions , where the thing changes , the light is , not the position of the <unk> .
you can play with different species .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from <unk> , where they can go to it , and through which they &apos;re moving through , they can look at many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to form a <unk> <unk> .
if you turn the light up , it looks like this . so , as we saw before .
imagine that every single person is controlled .
it could have every single <unk> of a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or so .
i want to show you something of the first one .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in <unk> -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as a impulse to the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> at the same time .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have <unk> , they can play with it and play with color motion and <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we work for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re involved in doing something to do something and change the environment -- almost as we call it , <unk> , like you move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation to a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing about the last year , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has <unk> everything , knowledge , and makes it accessible by the internet .
today , we can , for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- can we move from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the networks to the physical world .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the next challenges -- think of climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud from <unk> , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , share the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and other , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something on the top you can go , like london new <unk> .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important in the context .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
i had awe .
my heart <unk> , i was <unk> , while i was trying to make what was before me .
the <unk> around me , almost 60 feet out of the water , and i was just able to wonder that this was a <unk> in another character , year after year .
<unk> are born as a <unk> of a glacier or by taking out of <unk> .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get it more and <unk> in a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that you &apos;re easy to be isolated , separate and alone , very much as we often see people .
but the truth is far away .
during a iceberg , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg , he <unk> <unk> drinking water that feeds many life forms .
i go to my footage of this <unk> as if i do portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that you exist in these individual moments from this way , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of their <unk> along the life cycle .
a part of the ice in the <unk> that i <unk> is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i want to show you is a iceberg that i have in <unk> in greenland .
very rare , you can actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat is moving to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
he <unk> about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever been working , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from running , and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti inevitably is a complex part of what we admire and look at the world of art .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to say to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;ve heard to the higher <unk> and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers run .
i <unk> , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need , just a check , and instead i put a check from which i didn &apos;t have the <unk> idea of how i wanted to go .
because it &apos;s a <unk> that someone who is still wearing it , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then draw with a <unk> to draw the negative surface .
so they pull around and they make <unk> like these .
they say all the things that are shown up there , follow a life cycle .
it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , after the <unk> and finally , people actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we &apos;ve got the insurance on the doors , and in fact , for <unk> , we get a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and that we were <unk> , and all the images on the walls were <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a couple of things from the <unk> and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it itself , we put the code for free , the software can download for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital too .
every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this <unk> in front of the great revelation .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony <unk> for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we put his bed down , so we can see it outside .
we set up a <unk> against a wall of <unk> before the hospital .
and he drew again to the first time , in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was on the parking lot .
we also had to <unk> in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he sent us an email with the following content : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been drawing something .
i have the feeling , i was <unk> under water , and finally somebody <unk> down and <unk> my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us at the shelf , and it &apos;s going to continue us .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
and someone who has a <unk> potential is making so much more .
so we &apos;re in trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few prices .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then in december , the <unk> was honored as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it will give this april , the <unk> <unk> in the inner city of los angeles a exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be so pretty much the toughest representative of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m going to tell you , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had something to do with <unk> , but i just captured something and surrounded me with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs together .
and this question should every one of you , and that &apos;s every single day , where you have something that has to be done . if not now , when then ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i probably am america &apos;s most <unk> <unk> .
and i always say that i don &apos;t want to come to a scientist like this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , a epiphany for usually is something you find because you left it somewhere .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has made it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the <unk> green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me to use the toilet in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what they did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it suggested me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and at the time in the 1980s , i found it important to take a work on <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher , woman , <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned about each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to go away . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew we did .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults to know me , they turned into a box full , and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation that i talked about was showed .
the revelation is , the death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was so often mentioned today .
he needs the same -- it needs , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while you &apos;re up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds fear .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we might have caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot built the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he turn the engines off .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more with the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was <unk> , the life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about me this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
while i was thinking about it later , i got a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want to move more and more in life .
and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington bridge , pretty much for <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i <unk> to become better in everything i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego space .
and i <unk> the time i waste for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after i thought about it , i decided to <unk> negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t get to my wife two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and , during the inner clock , <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know of a <unk> .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , dying is not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare our lives for a long time .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really <unk> in an idea , which is that i just wish me a thing .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
about a month after that , i went to visit a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
... yet .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
i was clear at the time , by connecting the dots with each other , that it &apos;s just a great father to be in life .
more than everything , everything else , is my only goal in life , to be a good father .
i became the miracle of <unk> , in this day , not to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call at all that flies today is : imagine what happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it ; and how would you change ?
what would they do that they <unk> because they think they would be there forever ?
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can be .
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here are <unk> .
now , if we &apos;re going to make the systems , the systems and control the valves , then we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we create it that a effective <unk> is using a laptop on a laptop that is used by a <unk> to <unk> this gray box , then we are in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will go into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> , <unk> -- mission .
that &apos;s a simple thing , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started <unk> our research at six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense of the sense and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , what the <unk> part is , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed a little bit <unk> with these gray boxes , this <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention and we started a <unk> project where we had our environment with <unk> infected , and we studied this construction .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> was like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i realized that this was a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , if a particular configuration was discovered , even if the special program that is trying to infect it is trying to get on this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really <unk> my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> power plant or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> the <unk> code and found that he &apos;s <unk> in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were designed very professional , of people who had obviously had all the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that they had to attack .
probably they even knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we talk here -- about 15,000 lines .
looks quite like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so what we were looking for as first was <unk> <unk> because we know what that makes .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring this with the real world , with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or prove .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves , that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act around a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because there were most infections in there .
well , in this area there are not several thousand goals .
basically , it goes beyond the <unk> plant , and on the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; put me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we had found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the <unk> is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to crack the curved , and finally , to break the centrifuge .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to leave it slowly and incredibly complicated -- obviously in trying to make <unk> <unk> , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get it quickly behind .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of looking at us very exactly the data and the <unk> .
so for example , the number of <unk> <unk> is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to <unk> scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s called the <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for the one that we studied here .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a <unk> , and we had to collect us new .
anyway , we found that both digital <unk> is actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and you slow it , and the big <unk> comes with six <unk> in interaction and <unk> valves .
so , in the big and all , we are very confident that we actually have determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals from <unk> could be met .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- has really <unk> me out of the tongue .
down there is the gray box , and on the top , you see the <unk> box .
now , what this thing is doing is that it <unk> the <unk> values of sensors -- so for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it puts <unk> code that &apos;s still during the attack , with the wrong <unk> data .
and in fact , this false <unk> data is taken from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> is fed the <unk> with before <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more dangerous .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> there , where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power plant , for example , if the big <unk> will be fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if they are at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , yet the <unk> will notice .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and the thing i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing specifically to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work so well -- in a power plant or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predator -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we saw in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you finally get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we have to ask us the consequences and we &apos;re starting to prepare for us better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it got very much of it , that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> behind .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
i think the <unk> is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the <unk> superpower .
there are only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a <unk> . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place me in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time being dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with eating nothing than this to eat here -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i had an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk of 2011 .
but of course , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know , how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody could buy the <unk> .
if you asked me this one year , i would not have been able to tell you this with faith .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i went to some pretty terrible situations in the course of the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could get me to go to anything so difficult and so dangerous like these guys to go into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film around <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from the top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , completely <unk> -- from the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to infinity -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? forever , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to emphasis .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;re going to imagine that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to have the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show you that brands are a part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love to be happy when <unk> would help to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use <unk> , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how that &apos;s going to develop ?
how much money is money needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it in any case , to address some really familiar brands .
who knows , if the film comes out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is highly likely &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing because of the film or a difficult thing to me ?
<unk> : both .
so , it means , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people with which you have to do it ...
there are some places we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; ask the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out it meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just that way , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , to present your product as many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> that the mass brings up this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
that would not be a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but the thing that this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you put transparency in the <unk> , that -- this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; immediately understood ; <unk> of <unk> and access to information , especially what <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to the way that it should be implemented , anything changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scared -- like this strange bear , the still <unk> .
she &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish cool <unk> .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
look when i was a child and my father caught me in lying -- and there he is , and he looks at this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of each story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is getting understood is a broad problem .
i have friends who do big , giant <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , say that the reason their films are so successful is the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see <unk> in the movie ?
always , if i make me on the way , and always when i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i get a person , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so much ? you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you will have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well as women -- <unk> , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re as a brand a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , these things -- you know , remember <unk> -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe to <unk> ?
<unk> is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone does under the <unk> .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like to like beautiful clothes .
woman : &apos; 80s <unk> on <unk> , except for the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many <unk> and such a stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic rift valley .
man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : part <unk> , part <unk> , part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> in all the country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were <unk> .
man five : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often see me at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for you , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live his life , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that of the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the why &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that not them .
what other <unk> do you have to go through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of <unk> are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen from it .
there was a lot of crazy things there .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> had two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
the <unk> are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength instead of both .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii , <unk> of little <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is their brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would it be ?
do you have a <unk> ? are you something that the blood gets into <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little <unk> , <unk> , conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh as the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> , magical and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , holy , <unk> and ways like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film , that you use <unk> today to make the <unk> of the brain , both for advertising and movies .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school school , where companies are able to make their way into <unk> schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects from which i got most feedback or where i had the largest success , these are where i was doing things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think that our world view is challenges .
and how was it for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
well , because the film had been in the <unk> film festival , we can look at that .
according to the <unk> , the first thing in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million <unk> of this film .
this is actually just a period of two / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the movie has not been left .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has got a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every <unk> , which we talked to , has focused their clients to make the finger of it .
something that i believe is , is that if you take his opportunity to take the risks , the risks are that in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get it closer to failure .
i think that if you train his employees to avoid risks , you prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that you may <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
call the fear . call the risk welcome .
each one of the big <unk> , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of honesty for us .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you call transparency , &quot; was shown by my good friends of <unk> , the $ <unk> <unk> for the <unk> on ebay .
big data will turn to organizations around the world in big opportunities .
<unk> show &quot; you welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what &apos;s happening to the dollars of <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in the height of dollars to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i made something else in google , and i <unk> to make something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and the access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t get me -- but i had too many museums and this artwork didn &apos;t have access .
when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried this desire to make art accessible -- to lead to technology together .
we then <unk> a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van <unk> .
i even come into one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of kind of kind of new york .
you come to two because of pure -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- <unk> , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
you go around and you &apos;re <unk> .
they want to be <unk> in the museum ?
open the map , and jump it with a click .
in there you are , you want to be on the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
look for them .
thank you , but the best one comes .
so now i &apos;m one of my <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
this is now one of the images .
these are all <unk> .
those of you who are really interested in art can click -- but i &apos;m going to click that away .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve recorded with the so-called <unk> .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you see a little fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is <unk> .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i started to realize that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , spoke with a couple of familiar with the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s about a game called <unk> , where a <unk> is beaten with a stick with a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to get really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the <unk> , i <unk> to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see , like van <unk> , this mistake , because ?
you <unk> . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my <unk> to this picture , until i really am the cracks .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- the same if rich or poor , if you have a great house -- don &apos;t play a role .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
very simple , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put everything with comments , send your friends , and so a conversation starts about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , the main thing to me is that all of the wonderful things here are not google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to represent the digital medium of art and represent them quite online .
this is the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked to do recently : &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two <unk> .
this is the left half that &apos;s the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this one would be the completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see me as one of the people , in common with most other experimental <unk> , which need a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look at how it react . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same .
so one of the intuition you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing about the same time can be only in a place .
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed them .
i remember looking at a child playing on a <unk> .
he was another <unk> and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i bet that the play with the <unk> taught a very valuable lesson , because the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and they stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with their particles , they find all kinds of strange things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s only because i don &apos;t play with particles as often .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side , it doesn &apos;t like it .
because if all these things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , should not just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would feel better about the whole thing , if we could somehow show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the <unk> .
so what we look at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to <unk> it . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a bar , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours to all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool of hole and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of strange things , but then you get to the other people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to <unk> it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects feel the same .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind , which are over to them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal was <unk> , we had to <unk> all the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we went off the light , put it into a vacuum , and we <unk> the whole air and <unk> it to almost for now , alone in the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behavior like it always wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moves strange .
instead of that , it &apos;s just quiet , it <unk> it , the way it was <unk> was about as like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could <unk> it for the same time and not <unk> -- something that &apos;s only allowed in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not <unk> ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms from which the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time , the same atoms move and down .
just to accurate <unk> , they agree .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in the same time in two different places , this piece of metal in two different places can be , why not too ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would you understand that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece there .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality are just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal , if families think about where they want to live and work , they want to have the opportunity to choose between at least a hand full of different cities that all in competition is new residents .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who are not even available to a city that she would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them to build .
so we could just get the world very simple with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
this may be absurd for you , if you never thought about new cities .
but just trade the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine , half of the people who want to live in apartments do that ; the other half don &apos;t .
you could try to extend the capacity of the already existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to be able to do , in these apartments and their environment , there are laws of <unk> to avoid <unk> and <unk> from <unk> .
so it turns out to be very hard to keep out of these <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block , if the laws there would support a building such a building and not <unk> it .
so i proposed that governments can create new surfaces that offer enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform in <unk> .
in 2009 , <unk> was suffering under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a shift , whose program is both innovations , as also the <unk> promised .
he asked <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , test and study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city to the essentially elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t <unk> existing <unk> .
we pay new technologies great , but for the progress , it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s for usually laws that came back to us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him <unk> .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , on a place when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> , who meant that we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our land to the world .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and even once the fourth and fifth january , a talk .
so i gave another one with facts , which is a chart like this , which is trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area of least 1,000 <unk> .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite all <unk> .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and <unk> .
the head of congress came to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the possibility to live in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they voted for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> policy that &apos;s <unk> for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a intense crisis behind itself , was elected in congress for these <unk> with <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on the 17th of february , it was approved for the second time with <unk> to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and the october of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that built in south korea , <unk> big than the city city .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the <unk> .
the other place that was very interested in urbanization is singapore .
there are already two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it basically , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; and they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that <unk> allows in to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a external legal system .
a country has already offered his top court , as a court for the <unk> calling of the <unk> system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even get funding with one .
one thing , as you already know , has been <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many companies who like to put themselves in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who say they like to live permanent to another place .
a million people are leaving latin america every year and go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to <unk> their families to <unk> work sometimes , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who need to make enough money to afford food and clothing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes children who try to find their parents , who they , in some cases , have not seen more since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about building a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of thousands around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to make that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from <unk> have asked me to say , thank ted .
you know , how many decisions you do at a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that <unk> a typical americans on a day is 70 .
and also , recently a study was made with ceos where they saw a week of ceo .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with which these ceo &apos;s busy to do , and how much time they &apos;ve spent to make decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo of the week is busy with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues was , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of category in the one of the hour category .
how good , you think , are you in doing the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very very <unk> store , and at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had to drink <unk> .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i asked me , &quot; well , how does you never get something out ?
here &apos;s the olive gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including the ones that were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to the leader one day , and i asked the head , &quot; is this model that you really have the people in all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that came up every day and used their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we set up a little <unk> right at the entrance of the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i mean , what case would more people stay and try to get <unk> ?
it &apos;s more people standing when it was 24 , about 60 percent , as if it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we saw in what the case of the people bought a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who were left than it were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of glass .
from the people who were standing as there were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass , who they had six to choice as if they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our hip -- but it turns out that the <unk> is affecting us in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it goes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is saving .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we looked at the decisions for the retirement of almost a million americans from about <unk> plans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that was possible , the <unk> plan , has influenced the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found that in fact , there was a relationship .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans to give the two fund , a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the <unk> fell on about the <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out that even if you participate in the <unk> , if more possibilities for choice , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather , that the more possibilities they were available , the more that they <unk> and choose to choose and fund .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they put their whole money in pure <unk> .
no of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend , if you &apos;re important to your future financial well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences in people who offer the offer of more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push them , even if it is against their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide more for things that they &apos;re doing less happy , even if they do an objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy looking at these huge shelves full of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t actually pull the compare and <unk> and then can actually choose something from the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and on different <unk> -- that you can just apply to your business .
first , small .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
as <unk> and gamble , <unk> the different head and <unk> species of 26 to 15 , they experienced a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation <unk> her 10 to the worst of sold <unk> , they experienced that the profit was <unk> percent -- a result of both , the rise of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , they offer 45,000 products .
a typical walmart , today , offers 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which today is the <unk> supermarket in the world , is <unk> , and they just offer you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
every single harvard employees now automatically takes on a <unk> part .
those who really want to meet a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to show it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other are different .
and if your employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t do their clients . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said he would be ready to offer all people in this audience a <unk> vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read , and then i ask you to clap when you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to accept gary &apos;s supply .
are all that ?
okay , let me show you something more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that they were looking at <unk> , the first time they had more information than the second time , but i would have to guess that she felt the second time in the second .
because the pictures made it real .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding people , to understand the difference between possibilities , understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences have to be vivid and concrete .
why are people going on average 15 to 30 percent more if they use a <unk> or a credit card than in cash ?
because it &apos;s not the money we feel .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting exactly as much as it was , just put a little bit of it .
the small thing that we have held <unk> was that we asked people to think just to all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
third technology : <unk> .
we can deal with more categories than we can do more choices .
here &apos;s an example , a study we made in a <unk> .
it turns out that in the <unk> supermarkets and down in the northeast area , the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines have been <unk> to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left display is <unk> , and the display on the right is jazz , then you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right side is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something , not the choice .
and this problem , they often see , when they look at the long bullet points of all this fund .
who do you want to inform ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out , in fact , we can deal with more information than we think we just need to simplify them .
we need to slow the complexity up .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who offers the possibility to <unk> her car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices they offer per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , <unk> -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half of the clients is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> of the low possibilities , four <unk> .
the other half of the clients goes from the low opportunities , four <unk> , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how care they are .
if you use the <unk> in the decision , it means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what they find is that the people who go from many to the low <unk> are always to choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then stay with it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is changed the order of the information that this information is going to be .
if i start with the simple thing , i learn how i <unk> .
even though the <unk> choose to say nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still trying to pick it up .
it also puts me in excitement about the big product i &apos;m doing , and so i &apos;m ready to motivate me to be interested in being interested .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- <unk> -- are you going to get the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; <unk> -- we can deal with more categories , less possibilities ; to prepare for complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you choose to choose the choice .
and the more we &apos;re choosing , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i look at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , why that &apos;s all important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , <unk> -- when i was young , that seemed so infinite .
but <unk> has allowed us to be all <unk> or all our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours a minute , they &apos;re uploaded to a minute .
again , there &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever going to be <unk> and will look at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> of this video that he had filmed in front of his house in a high national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like the video was popular for the first time for the first time .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that , if you call <unk> mountain <unk> .
he had given a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually sent in january , actually .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : the tweet that made the video at the end of the last time .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , we ask us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; it seems to be out of nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael <unk> nelson &apos;s nelson theater was one of the first people to do a joke about twitter .
important is that a individual or a group of <unk> took a point of view , shared with a big audience and accelerated the process .
then this community of people formed these big <unk> , and started talking about it and playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a <unk> for every single <unk> .
unlike the <unk> conversation of the 20th century , the participation of community is going to become our way of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you hold this for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> , which was looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity , which are in the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground , made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do with .
who would have seen all of this ?
who would see &quot; double <unk> &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; ?
what <unk> did you have to write in which kind of <unk> ?
in a world where every minute , two days of video is uploaded , just really unique and unexpected <unk> like the <unk> videos .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in when i was a friend , i should be looking at this great video , about a guy who <unk> in new york against <unk> .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there are disabilities that make you don &apos;t go properly on the <unk> .
because this was completely surprising and <unk> , casey <unk> was a funny idea and his argument was five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and this all leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access , and in which the audience is <unk> .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin <unk> -- made his beginning on youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling also as the owners of our culture culture .
and these are not the features of the old media , and they can &apos;t meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still made together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was <unk> by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold him in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> eyes , as he has to say that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> his .
he moved to the silence .
he died , broken through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was absolutely trying to <unk> us , but we &apos;ve been through it .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> is <unk> on lake .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , life had asked her a task : the escape from your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that she could fail .
after a four year-old and <unk> <unk> , a boat is <unk> on the sea , as <unk> <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear had they , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> at it .
in a <unk> , my sister and i would have drinking her self and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the engine , the clapping of one every wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came a lot of times , but let me make the men of the men on our boat , or at the <unk> of the engine , who didn &apos;t want six hours .
no apple ever tasted so much again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in 1975 .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations , who build a new life together .
we let us down in <unk> , one from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> were <unk> between people who had a thing in common : they started <unk> .
my mother worked on farms , then on a <unk> in a <unk> , six days , twice the layers .
they could somehow find their time to have english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar was <unk> and was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to give up . most of the things were the new things that came out of the second hand .
two <unk> for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there , and there &apos;s &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting for reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night , until their <unk> came , so i could wake them up .
she opened a <unk> , then made a <unk> and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t get the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looking for them .
centers have been built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands on itself .
in the other , i was involved in <unk> life , wearing the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many have got about the years of help .
and because of this help , i was chosen in my last year of <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was <unk> by a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
<unk> le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was now <unk> le , refugee and social activist who were invited to talk to places that they had never heard , and in homes , their existence that they could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old , as she was at the time , when we climbed the boat .
no one had never been a possibility .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of you did what they loved , lived on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i could not live with a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead so easily to the collapse of the <unk> , can mean so easy that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world , but not how you <unk> .
opportunities that were not allowed to be allowed was explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut machine .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; doesn &apos;t go &quot; a <unk> challenge .
a year we had no cents .
at the end of a day i was cooking a huge <unk> soup that we shared .
we worked too late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a few brilliant about it , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
just a journey there .
my gut reaction again .
three months later i moved , and the adventure went further .
before i get the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> , the social norm and the local <unk> was the most important person .
life has not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved them alone .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a <unk> , whose mother suggested it .
without the support of your husband , she was worried about a <unk> by bringing him to court , and <unk> in their own case , and a bigger <unk> when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; turned out to be a <unk> .
i &apos;d just <unk> in a hotel in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in spain .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them stand on the other side .
i knew she came to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk> .
we told her stories and they told her that we were still in her .
at midnight , the monk was coming , and he said he had to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk : &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t catch them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives that would have come to us in the <unk> .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every wave , the <unk> , <unk> of the engine , the long horizon , no one ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it could be safe , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all of photography at all ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t pick up with his camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera , was at the age of 15 .
i put it with my former <unk> for drawing , but it was a little different , because in the use of the camera , the process was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , ends the process , if you press the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more about going to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to start when the trigger is going to be <unk> .
photos like this : a construction site along a lot of <unk> street .
but it has an unexpected change .
and it still <unk> a realistic level .
or photos like these -- dark and <unk> , but all with the common goal , to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really can capture , but i always want to see it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photographs , where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that &apos;s going to look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect <unk> objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain kind of each other , you can create something that is still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in the combine of photos .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily lives .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic result .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but combined , you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
second , <unk> photos should have the same <unk> .
and these two images meet these two demands -- shot out of the same height , and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by connecting them <unk> .
makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was <unk> .
but this picture is actually completely combined , from photos of different places .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to make a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank is from a different place .
the <unk> is from a <unk> .
and yes , i even got the house up on the island of red , to look at it .
so to reach a realistic result , this is what it &apos;s like from me to planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here , every piece of a piece is very good .
and if you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it can also be pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re going to have is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why a lot of electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced in the <unk> was a <unk> .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific about it -- you &apos;re putting a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe only most of the electronic <unk> <unk> , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she has a button , a button .
and every morning i go on it .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds of <unk> .
it works very simple : every time i get on the scale , my data is also sending my data to google health .
and there they are , also , from my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need to help or do that , but also with a look in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i go to my <unk> , and people are talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , you want to be just a little <unk> today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could <unk> patients to smoking .
it could also be used to get people from their chairs and to bring them to play any kind of game to control their health better .
next week it comes to the market .
there will be this little <unk> that you get to an iphone or so on .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to your doctor , to share it for others , for something more than 100 dollars .
make ways that are easy to use and start with this one , to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these ways , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you a quick video .
we have all the <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the machines around the <unk> are around .
we know one another where all the gas stations are .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> be to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next <unk> <unk> was in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> are already reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone is <unk> , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you have your <unk> to find the next <unk> to save life .
and by today , we don &apos;t just want to take this as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> , to <unk> these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re on holiday and someone goes down , it &apos;s your own <unk> or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies all over the world help us in <unk> of these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in his place .
please help us , and try and make health not only something , but to take a hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to force us to conservation , by the way .
... the <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take , until it &apos;s <unk> .
well -- we can just jump that -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for <unk> .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what is possible today .
so you meet al .
al &apos;s a <unk> in the city of boston .
how did he come to search for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston with the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has been a lot of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never <unk> that fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , still noticed something else , and that was that the residents had to <unk> the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what every good designer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that the fellows have written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do other <unk> .
it &apos;s spreading fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> center of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
that &apos;s how he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people who <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities , planning to use this app .
and she has spread all the time , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s usually not going to go .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston , for three people , two and a half months .
it was about a way that parents can figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were later told that if it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and this is not even anything .
there is now a project in the california justice project , which the <unk> cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread from <unk> , is a kind of shot before the bug on the institution of government .
she shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that she represents a new generation that <unk> the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we are very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools we need to do things in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; and there are hundreds of people in the whole country that write up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up to the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know something that we lost out of the eyes .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you that you &apos;re going to go through it because the things change .
politics is not changing ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally gets their power from us -- <unk> you : &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , in the government , it &apos;s mostly about choosing people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the end that it &apos;s mostly in communities to go to <unk> .
this is the call for service and information .
there you usually come out , if you &apos;re in your city , <unk> .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talked about human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s digital the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citizen helped a other citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could be able to connect them with government performance , if that would have been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengths our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that , government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that it is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is vote .
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt of the thing we own , and for us to pay , something that makes us work against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to get into the machines of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we need to reach what we need to reach without the institution to improve the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government is fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by <unk> the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight , which we all fight , to talk to who to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make your opinion , on every channel to every time , and you do .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care to use their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be , a fire fire , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> .
and sure , we &apos;d have these these fire fires to be able to <unk> all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and they receive performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... maybe you could show the slide for a moment .
this is a slide i happened to have chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s actually about the general shape .
this slide shows a analysis of a analysis of us about the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
the interesting here is that this slide , like so many other , which we often find in our field , is a kind of just on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we need to use this guy scale on <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back again .
a little bit deeper , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
and they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would come on the <unk> scale , in a flat line , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the <unk> circumstances .
so if the <unk> would go as fast as the <unk> , we could get <unk> into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
this has never been before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which the scale has to grow exponentially .
the question i &apos;d like to ask you , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is evolved for forever and forever .
there are two possibilities .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s what it is .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this will happen in the way here .
is that really , then that means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition here .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the <unk> world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often ask myself , is how this new world is probably going to be ?
what is this new condition that the world takes slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future still is in 2000 .
further than that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future every year has dropped a year since i was on this world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize that anything is going on .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that there is just no sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what that could be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about some other things that really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back a step and look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life of the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense , if you divide it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of these <unk> chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture of how it &apos;s <unk> .
some of these oil spills have a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
all those were , they started <unk> .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> in the sense .
but these oil spills were not about alive in today &apos;s senses , because every single one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared it , the chemicals in it have been distributed to different amounts of chemicals .
so every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> that had one for the growth of <unk> chemistry had faster than other and integrated more chemicals from the outside and shared it faster .
so these are the <unk> to survive longer , and it <unk> in <unk> degrees .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it becomes if these <unk> learned a trick about abstraction .
in any kind of way we don &apos;t understand , these <unk> have learned the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe from the cell as information , and it &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found in this <unk> , evolutionary kind of way that allowed them to <unk> , so that this information was stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information over the time of 2.5 billion years , in which she came out , stayed the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and every living creature uses the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can write just to the <unk> , even thing in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in the airports away from <unk> .
it &apos;s -- what i did , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use to the <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i put it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been a <unk> , i would have written them on a virus and released it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and that <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s why these cells started communicating and sharing information so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace your dna .
and that &apos;s why , for example , growing the <unk> of antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can stay from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
so this communication allowed the reasons of communities which were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they were either survived together , or they went together . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals in the community were repeated more and more than evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> on the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which act together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not left alone .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop , so that the level that evolution happened , no longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> of what we call organism .
the next step was now happened within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that these <unk> have built .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and holding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning was now happening within the period of life of a single organism instead of this evolutionary period .
so a organism could not learn to eat a certain fruit , because she liked bad , and made him sick , the last time he ate them .
this could now happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were needed , because these information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of these fruit , because these <unk> were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the <unk> with this particular <unk> because evolution could now happen within a individual .
it could happen within a time of <unk> .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
once , as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> , <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and there &apos;s basically <unk> notes from me , in hope , to create a similar <unk> idea in your head , which has a certain similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is , we started abstract .
we go through the same steps that have gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we present data to present , process .
for example , the invention of language was a little step into this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to continue to develop faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds .
you also saw <unk> little <unk> where he showed a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> again .
the first steps of the story i told you about , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> some hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , they just seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding themselves from itself and becomes , i think , <unk> is the word for -- if something <unk> its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live alive from computers and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently made progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
and it makes it part of the way that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been doing in the last time , is evolution itself .
and we install a <unk> in the machine which is happening in the <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please have a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now , you &apos;re all going to run out of these randomly chosen instructions , lead all the programs , and finally choose the ones that my <unk> are at the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to turn numbers , that would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve used for that .
so find programs that can kind of kind of the most likely number of numbers .
of course , the chance at random <unk> is very small , that they kind of kind of <unk> numbers , so you don &apos;t have to make any of the instructions to do this .
but one of them may have two numbers of numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , now take the 10 percent of the sequences that my <unk> have come to .
store these , <unk> the rest .
now all the <unk> that the numbers have in the best <unk> .
and it &apos;s with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the features of the <unk> from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came from combinations of programs that have come closer to the goals than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
put it again .
maybe a few mutations .
and try this all over again with another generation .
all these generations need few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can turn numbers perfectly .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than every program i can ever write by hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s <unk> and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of <unk> programs that did the job .
because your life was based on whether you did the job right .
i used to sit in a boeing with louise <unk> , he <unk> a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made of <unk> <unk> , who work together to make their flight safer . &apos; &quot; don &apos;t you do that <unk> ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re going to leave us on computers , for a process that is very different from the classic engineering technology .
he allows us things with a lot higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so <unk> <unk> the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so we can be able to do these processes even faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it &apos;s going faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we raise .
we have come to a point , the analog is at the time , as a <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make out what the hell we &apos;re going to create here .
we are in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after we get something else .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s always coming next .
well , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear here now before i &apos;m still going to be <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that nothing changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in the middle of the indian , we went into a car and we went to the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , took out in the ground and water came out .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a lot of fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without <unk> to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my idea .
i came up with this as i thought we were sending our send clocks and cameras out of it .
they kept us inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to allow magic instead of killing magic .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that readers can connect to the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
storytelling has always needed more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here it says , &quot; put your finger on light . &quot;
and so -- here , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited by these possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and a kite , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found very exciting .
so you have to <unk> the ipad and <unk> the fireflies .
and the light <unk> the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and so here every book and every world is going to be a little <unk> that i &apos;m going to go here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> have always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and <unk> and serves to a guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows other places of the book .
i go in here .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of the <unk> and the <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that <unk> with new issues , like the <unk> .
in the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their <unk> , on their computers , without <unk> .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the <unk> images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do more .
this <unk> is <unk> . you have to go out to make a photograph of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities with magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan a interaction with which you use the video of the <unk> , and through <unk> reality , a animation of <unk> looks like a plant in front of the house .
on a place , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , read it and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of the technology can come closer , and in the magic and technology , we can go .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there &apos;s a lot of despair .
here at ted , to see and hear how inspiring that is , i gave me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i got a clear : ted has an identity .
you can tell things about the world &apos;s impact .
and sometimes , when something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and power that else could not have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher meaning , but that the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i haven &apos;t learned that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
she was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a slave .
she was born to <unk> , and the experience of slavery made their view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also <unk> .
if i met her as a young boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
she <unk> me so that i could barely breathe . then they left me .
one or two hours later , when i saw her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no , &quot; they <unk> me again . if i said &quot; yes , &quot; she made me quiet .
she was something that made that you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around all the way .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first of all , i thought that this would be a game .
i saw them and smiling , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me over the hand , and she took me to the hand , and she said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i told me you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; well , the next thing i told me is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is a year older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with her sister and me and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> around there as well .
then he took a drink of beer and gave my sister one , and she took me , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . do you . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now we do that , but you can do anything we do .
i had something , your sister had what . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . do it . do it only . &quot;
my brother <unk> me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
then he saw me in the face and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
i was destroyed by the ground .
i &apos;m going to admit you something .
i should probably not do that .
this is perhaps going to be public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i never had to drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these were the issues we needed to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in <unk> , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world today .
seven million people are released to the <unk> or <unk> .
i think <unk> is changing our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population are despair and despair because of these changes .
one of three male black black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in jail , in the prison , on the <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , in the prison , on the <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also being <unk> by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treat much better when they are rich and guilty than arm and innocent .
fortune , not <unk> , affects the result .
yet we seem to be very happy to be .
a politics of fear and anger have convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i find that interesting .
there are some <unk> developments .
my home house einstein <unk> you <unk> the <unk> if you &apos;re convicted of <unk> .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population still have lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the <unk> of the civic <unk> is as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , <unk> children to death in prison .
in this country , there are <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : has a person deserve to die for one of him to die ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did somebody make death for death , but : did we deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty of america is defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve executed , one that we have for innocent <unk> , the <unk> and from death row was released .
an amazing <unk> . one from nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let someone fly with a airplane , if for nine planes , the <unk> , a crash .
but somehow we make it <unk> from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking to my students <unk> history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their life .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re running together all the time .
we &apos;re always creating new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to overcome , without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i gave some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear them like that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give them more in germany . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever ever describe us again for the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> of us , aware and <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state left people to <unk> , especially if there were many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , there is this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to make in a complex world .
for me , the time is to create and think about the poor , the poor , the <unk> , the ones that are never going to be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all have to believe in the end of things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we are rational as much as we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe is driving us , not just to be open for all the light and the <unk> things , but also for the dark and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted everything . but what we needed most was hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be sometimes in <unk> places , and witness . &quot;
this mental guidance is the core of what i believe that the <unk> need to be engaged for that .
there &apos;s no distinction around technology and design that allows us to be very human , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more about us than if we don &apos;t care about that .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege , to meet pink parks .
so these women met , and they were just talking .
and to call , woman <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , wife parks come to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very well . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , woman parks at me said to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the <unk> initiative is for the same .
what are you trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
<unk> want to help people be convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without the <unk> <unk> for children .
we want something against the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to eliminate <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will make you very , very tired . &quot;
then woman <unk> in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i believe that the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to <unk> ways to ask these challenges : these problems , that sorry .
because ultimately our humanity is based on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone lies , he &apos;s not just a liars .
if someone takes something that he doesn &apos;t hear , he &apos;s not just a <unk> .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to the end .
sometimes i urge too .
i &apos;m going to tired , like we all .
sometimes these ideas are <unk> to our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these children who have been convicted of very hard <unk> .
i go to the <unk> , and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that should be a adult .
and then i ask myself , how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long and thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish to you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on a <unk> .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as a client .
and i started with this : the headline was : &quot; <unk> , my poor , black clients , like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my <unk> , i explained that failure of the <unk> and the police and the police and <unk> are to be <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , nothing more <unk> is that there &apos;s only error .
the next morning , i woke up , i didn &apos;t know if i had just written this crazy <unk> , or actually written him .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write it , but sent him to the court .
a few months went over , and i just had everything forgotten .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to tell you the dish and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that it &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car , and i went up the staircase for the court .
when i went to the court of the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you are lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and he <unk> me .
then he <unk> me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched me something very deep in me , identity , the ability every single , something to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you asked these crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started arguing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry was we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors and go off .
he always saw through the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat right behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
during the pause , a <unk> in the <unk> came out that the janitors were in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
i came to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral <unk> of the universe is far <unk> , but that it <unk> the justice .
we &apos;re not completely developed as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival with the survival is every single person .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who also see that , just saying , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
they have seen in this audience , this community , seen a obvious wish and heard to help and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s going to actually build a effort , something from the <unk> <unk> that else is flowing in the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty of a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t end with a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> aren &apos;t coming in front of the court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this <unk> is going to suggest that the money is in more <unk> and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the <unk> of america is enormous down .
this fact is often asked in a relationship with the increased <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not changed very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> of drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
we have <unk> us from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> that bring people to the <unk> for a <unk> , for the theft of <unk> good , rather than you forces you to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people have become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current world is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a string of a string .
they are an inspiring personality .
thank you for being ted . thank you .
and bin laden &apos;s death brings up an increased <unk> of <unk> .
speakers two : famine in somalia . speakers three : spray <unk> .
speakers 4 : <unk> <unk> . <unk> 5 : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . <unk> <unk> : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . nine : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . weapons of weapons . tornado .
recession . <unk> . egypt . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer it to show us negative topics because our minds are exactly the issues of attention .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second of every day our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re nothing more important than our survival , the first station for all the information is part of our <unk> , the <unk> .
so the <unk> is our early detection system , our <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all the information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , which is seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all these negative news in day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always getting worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces is so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already got it .
and as people , we &apos;re much better at <unk> problems on a very long view , but they finally get to overcome .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , the <unk> <unk> of the world population .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
this is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs have reduced to a <unk> .
steve pinker has shown us that we are now in a very peaceful time of <unk> life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> in the past 130 years was 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget that .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we have defined poverty .
think that a big percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , <unk> , tv , mobile , <unk> and cars .
the richest <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , could never be able to dream like that .
the basis of a lot of them create technologies , and these grow <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is doubled , and the <unk> doubled all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less and is thousands of times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how <unk> it is -- in good times as in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s slow down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , it &apos;s up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everybody .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> <unk> watson at risk .
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking at the newspapers , looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the <unk> of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence would be available to every owner of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university , called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services , which can be able to affect the lives of billions of people within a decade .
think about that a group of students today can influence the life of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can <unk> in dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating <unk> abundance .
<unk> is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> itself got <unk> .
but the king of <unk> got <unk> .
aluminum was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made of aluminum .
although <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> , it doesn &apos;t come out as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy to the future .
we think of <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet which is filled with <unk> more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees in the comparison of 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was 50 percent last year .
last month , this has published a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar is six cents per <unk> , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll also have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl <unk> , in 1990 , was the <unk> of 1990 when it was on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet who is covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent water , two percent are <unk> , and we fight for 170 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
it can create a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether water , <unk> water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just <unk> , to start a big <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything is going well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to apply this technology global in <unk> countries across the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , you know , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones in the developing world until the end of 2010 .
remember that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better <unk> than president reagan before 25 years ago .
and if you look at google on google , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , like no one ever could have predict .
and it gets better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical imaging -- now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing is maybe what &apos;s expected to be health .
last month , i had the pleasure , with the <unk> , called the &quot; $ 10 million <unk> of <unk> x prize . &quot;
we demand teams around the world , to connect all these technologies into a cell phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s <unk> , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the employees of health care .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the heart disease and prevent a pandemic before their outbreak .
but now the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of surplus .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the largest <unk> against a population population is a better education and diet in the entire world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we get <unk> from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before are going to join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of <unk> gridlock , i see one of the largest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier with the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;re better trained by the <unk> , and by doing that they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and <unk> computing and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> get us ?
how about a sentence of new , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to make attention and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people will bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excited me .
there &apos;s a program that some may already know .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will develop .
depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
now this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern pattern better <unk> the proteins and the best supercomputer .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges and to do what is necessary .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been long enough in the business , when i can allow me to give up a piece of my own wrong <unk> to allow this .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are close to the <unk> and move to the world world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems to be soon and turns to statistics , and to use these to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to bring me to a statistic of what i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 , when a bat gets 300 .
that means that the player is sure three of 10 beats is beating .
it &apos;s called the ball in the <unk> , he comes up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball into the first base , it didn &apos;t get in time , and the <unk> was in security .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
good , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how you call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> baseball player who met during a <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> to a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 is in terms of <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved people with <unk> <unk> , and your <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> , whose <unk> is in <unk> at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and they &apos;re beating a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think of the <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor should be .
what we &apos;re doing is that we are every one of them , including me , to be perfect in the world with the claim .
never make a mistake , but no one is doing the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters in the sisters of the toronto general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> every <unk> , every branch of a artery that <unk> from the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew , if i knew everything , and i knew everything , or at least as close as possible , as close to <unk> as possible that i was immune to doing mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met woman printer .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto as a woman printer brought me into the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point , i was <unk> the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for the <unk> .
and to give feedback to my <unk> .
i studied woman printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i <unk> her , they made <unk> sound .
and when i got their chest up with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered from <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart failed , instead of pumps the entire blood , <unk> a part of the blood of the lung in the lung , and <unk> these gradually , so the <unk> came .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i asked her and made me to the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of hearts .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so they <unk> the liquid .
and over a period of a half and two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and there i was doing my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take the <unk> and did what i would have been , what a call at my <unk> would have been to <unk> it with him , so that he had a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to have extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take his responsibility that i was like that , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them home , i <unk> a quiet voice in me , trying to say to me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was very missing to me that i asked the nurse , which was to take care of a woman printer , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go good . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an <unk> and <unk> and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i went on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , <unk> the hospital and went to the parking lot with the car at home when i did something that i didn &apos;t do else .
i went home from the <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the woman printer , but one other three words to me , and these three words fear most of the <unk> i know .
other medical doctors fear these as well , but the <unk> is very special because we just see the patients just as <unk> .
the three words say , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that you were sending to home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about an hour after she sent home , after i sent her home , she <unk> , and the family called <unk> . the <unk> brought them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they didn &apos;t breathe , and she was blue .
the <unk> moved all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them up to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was in the inner <unk> .
and i went through these <unk> because they came to the center of the <unk> , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , it was clear that she would never go back again .
she had not suffered a <unk> <unk> .
their family got together .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they created the <unk> .
on the <unk> day , they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you don &apos;t forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this itself .
if you do <unk> and you never do the mistake again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> kind of thing i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that it &apos;s not what you did , it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it was not on the reason of my <unk> , he was very <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was going to <unk> the <unk> and made sure i wasn &apos;t going to be done .
but i asked me to have these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why did i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly but sure , it put it .
i started feeling better .
and then in a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke , and i might say i can feel better again .
and i was talking to me that if i doubled my effort to perfection and never <unk> a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> in a <unk> hospital north toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a small little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not a infection of the <unk> , but the upper <unk> and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and <unk> , i felt <unk> and went to the work of the work until it came again and again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve lost two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no <unk> in their treatment as well .
in one thing , i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the kidney . when this was no <unk> , my colleague , at the <unk> of the patient , had a <unk> in the lower right sector , and i called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues for him as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he realized a <unk> in the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it went good .
both cases <unk> on me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes happened in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i tell the quiet voice that tells me what really didn &apos;t happen , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same ?
if i had a room in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who talked about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , they go to a cocktail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about the own mistakes .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that a <unk> in my hospital would have lost the wrong leg , then you think i had problems to look in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . these , the <unk> <unk> and the shake , the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological response like antibodies to attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make those that make mistakes from medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system that happens every day in a day , where one of 10 <unk> is either a wrong or wrong <unk> , in which the <unk> is always going to be more and more and more and more and more and <unk> or dead .
in this state , about 1,500 <unk> in this state die of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute for medicine was <unk> the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong <unk> because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> , in the medical knowledge , all two to three years are doubled , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give a slightly <unk> breath , and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are inevitable .
so if you take the system as i was taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then no one &apos;s left .
and do you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and then their <unk> , they &apos;ve found out of the head , then they look down , they eat hard , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i have . &quot;
what they need is a environment that you put in the position .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the <unk> doctor is a human , white to his humanity , accept it , is not proud to make mistakes , but put everything out of them so that it can be passed .
she shares their experiences with others .
they support if others talk from their mistakes .
and she shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , supportive way all of that benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that is so , people also make mistakes from time to time .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best for it to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories before the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
they like to think that he <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he collected fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
to the &apos; 80s , in the &apos; 80s , he was <unk> in great style .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of endangered species .
this story has been heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> are still describing them as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is a different concept that <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 in a <unk> in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really get out of there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the <unk> of <unk> and from a few <unk> were <unk> .
there were <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were living good , and they were making average in ghana .
when i got back 27 years later , the fish went down to half of his size .
<unk> measure them five inches .
they were genetically <unk> .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe has a lot of <unk> .
<unk> meant countries that started 100 thousand fish , the industrial fishing was this pretty ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
i went with it , and we did <unk> in the entire southern sea sea , and especially in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started .
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were <unk> , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the <unk> , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came up , and then it was <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you take a survey , and you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral will be <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living alive .
she was not <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> is <unk> every time from fishermen when they drive into areas where they &apos;ve never been <unk> .
but it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> of the new level and don &apos;t call us the memory of what was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green your country , the <unk> .
at the time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are very natural .
every generation looks at the images that they take at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and becomes everything from that .
the difference is then seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and at the end , you just want to get the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s exactly what our goal now is .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like they were .
you could think that the problem was in people who certainly lived in <unk> societies , killed animals , and they were just aware of what they were doing .
because obviously a animal that was very often gave it is not even rare before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a common natural animal .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
at the time , we focus on the big animals and the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re rare because we start them .
with the time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
now , because you don &apos;t know that it was even different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
you will confirm it , because the evidence that you &apos;re looking at in a former form is not how you like to argue the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a <unk> saying that &apos;s seen in this area of great <unk> can &apos;t be used , or , usually , not <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because <unk> , we &apos;re basically asking the past .
we put the past again that people can &apos;t understand , because the <unk> have changed and it &apos;s very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and that benefit from the insight that allows it to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of <unk> bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and the <unk> may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- besides the <unk> , why were you so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little <unk> that went out in a way .
so my suggestion , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is about cameron , so he turns &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist <unk> , you had to , if you had a typewriter , you had to <unk> this in the government .
they also had to take a sheet of <unk> out of this typewriter .
the reason is , the government could <unk> where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , and they could find the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that the freedom of speech would be <unk> .
in our own countries we would never do something like that .
this is what happens to us today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example , which is the way our own governments have the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing <unk> .
let &apos;s see what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in <unk> .
and the motivation of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss <unk> of mr. sam <unk> here , and on this bank , <unk> million dollars were <unk> when it was frozen .
mr. <unk> itself is on a foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only become worse .
in the future , most crime are going online .
the second second thing that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protest about , a opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and have become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are doing it for money , <unk> like anonymous , who do resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that lead the attacks .
there are cases in front of us , like the <unk> .
it shows <unk> what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody was hacked , and he had hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the <unk> of this group , whether he could make it possible because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in the consequence of a remote range ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate you need a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example .
but can you yet , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
how does it behave with the arab spring and the things that are happening for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the <unk> in april of 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , the notes were one in germany , a local company , who sold the egyptian government to a few programs that they had -- in very big frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is exactly here .
so western governments provide <unk> governments with <unk> that can be able to do against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-called <unk> found , that was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s quite security to <unk> your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer to people is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we are today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , it &apos;s every right that we &apos;re going to make , for always <unk> .
and do we trust , we trust the blind of every future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made of <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> from concrete with <unk> measurements that fit .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into building things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
basically , the <unk> was become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego with this came out .
it &apos;s called the automatically <unk> stone .
and within less years , lego in every household did .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks are produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego , it made it possible for everybody .
lego is basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at the same year bell , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that would bring us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks into a world that was all interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much bigger , more complex cycles , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that the building block of our time is fair for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> , who have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect to magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them in the wrong way .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
all you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build bigger <unk> .
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
they can fit a switch in between , and they made a little <unk> .
take the switch out to make a <unk> that &apos;s here , <unk> , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
add these <unk> to an extra effect , and they have made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
over the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> allows you to program simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow it down or to slow down , they just turn on this button , and he makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread <unk> to children and see them play .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you have in the day , and you don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a <unk> work , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responded to touch .
we also brought <unk> to <unk> .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we got <unk> to risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics was just going to be another material .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go to the website , download all the <unk> and make them themselves .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull it and start to invent .
thank you .
