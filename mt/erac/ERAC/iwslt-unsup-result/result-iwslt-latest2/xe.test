and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to come out with the <unk> separation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique <unk> of <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
all of these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to focus on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can be only in hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world form a net of <unk> and <unk> life that <unk> earth , and for the best of the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re able to do as an amazing <unk> species .
and as the biosphere became strong , this was happening with the <unk> -- only more than bigger speed .
and the crucial exception to this is the extinction of languages .
when every one of you was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
one language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool that finds the soul of a certain culture access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages , today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , just half not more in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore , it &apos;s called , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely when the silence was <unk> to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , don &apos;t have a possibility to give up the wisdom of the ancestors or to expect the hope of the ancestors ?
and yet , this terrible fate actually happens somewhere on earth , about all two weeks , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , a elderly man dies and takes the last <unk> language of an old language with his grave .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then they suddenly realized what it would be if they couldn &apos;t speak their own language .
so today i want to take you through a journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> , to try to understand them , to understand what was actually lost .
now there are some of us that forget that i think if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different ways of being his .
take this child of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east from holy snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively different between the colors blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people depend on is <unk> .
they have a strange language , and a <unk> called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who talks to another language .
all of this is <unk> in the <unk> past , and the strange thing about these big houses where they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages is that you never hear someone listening to someone who &apos;s learning a language .
they just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived in , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was first been <unk> in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> tried to touch , and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw <unk> photos from the air , which we would judge as a friendly gesture , and so they forgot that these people had never seen something <unk> in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , nothing and <unk> found that this was the business plan of the devil and killed five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just kill the <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
74 percent of deaths happened by <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forest that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps away and determine what species of this was in .
so to give you a sense of that <unk> , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable faith in <unk> , and <unk> is not a culture of black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them , the great world leaders were reading , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always gone out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith , and of course there was one and <unk> is just the <unk> of this very profound religious thoughts , which <unk> during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> .
but what makes <unk> interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gives us the minds of the living .
the minds can be <unk> under the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to replace the soul of the living , so that the <unk> is going to be for a short <unk> moment to god .
<unk> would like to say , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god . &quot;
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take you from the mind . how can you be made to be damage ?
look at this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal without burning , an amazing visualization of the ability of the mind to influence the body so that it &apos;s <unk> when he &apos;s being <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met were the <unk> from sierra nevada de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , who <unk> the heart institute of colombia , and in the consequence of the <unk> , this people went back into a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered by the <unk> .
until today &apos;s day , they &apos;re led by a ritual <unk> , and the education to the <unk> is very extraordinary .
and during this whole time , they are introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers to be responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so , <unk> are not <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
well , what does that mean ?
if he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor which is defined by the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon northwest .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> <unk> from the repertoire of <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that are very similar to serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you saw the <unk> , as you &apos;re looking at this stuff , this substance that makes them different from different ways .
and this powder is a bit like being <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and land on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not produced <unk> of reality , but the resolution of reality .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because , of course , by a human gut , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> by names , <unk> .
they can only be <unk> in connection with some other chemicals that are <unk> by mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> , <unk> from exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . so ask yourself .
how can these people <unk> from a <unk> of 80,000 species of plants that are not using these two <unk> plants that are combined , if in this way , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of his parts ?
we use this great <unk> , attempt and mistakes , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , has 17 varieties of <unk> , which you all see in a big distance in the forest that appear for our eyes as a kind of way .
and then you ask them how they justify their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understood something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties of <unk> , and you sing to one in a different <unk> .
well , this doesn &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the <unk> problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position of native , they look like <unk> and <unk> , but kind of limited to the past , while the real world , which means our world .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t hear less in the sioux when they were <unk> and arrow as the americans stopped being americans when they were <unk> and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of regime .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i &apos;m working on a lot , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinct of people will be convicted in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the human lifestyle , is not just convicted , but in general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering from <unk> , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on a <unk> level .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as the tag of the <unk> lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle <unk> with her holiness in the diaspora that people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked in as a punishment for being rich for the crime .
he was <unk> in prison for two years to hide under their <unk> , because she could not live without him .
the sister who did this brave thing was made in a <unk> .
one day they came out of <unk> <unk> , and for these <unk> , they had to go to a heavy camp for seven years .
the suffering of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> mind of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really concerned about a choice . do we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , which brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that created poetry by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus , only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this <unk> story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the next millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> to the meaning of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always working very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years in the <unk> of our regime , they were forced to pull out in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold , they used them to use their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> was originally made from fish that was made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the flying storm .
he <unk> out , he made his pants down from <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and when the feces started to <unk> , he shaped them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the pages of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a different dog and <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> on the <unk> .
so you can &apos;t do something like that .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all native to the world .
the canadian government gave the chimpanzees , in april 1999 , complete control over an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , is looking for their people and can achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be the dreams of our own children part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
<unk> nations are sending our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
thank you .
we see a lot , a lot of <unk> on digital photos here , which you can <unk> and constantly <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the <unk> scan , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can measure the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this , to really show you that this is a real representation of the <unk> and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and they really have the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we &apos;ve also made something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a wrong display with very high <unk> , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical <unk> .
and this really reaches these ideas to end these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean <unk> and other nonsense , which should not be necessary .
of course , <unk> is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we are also going to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which is <unk> by noah <unk> , a <unk> of washington , under the advice of steve <unk> on the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we can create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the <unk> <unk> .
but the spatial structure of images here is actually the meaning of meaning .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more <unk> .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
so this is all <unk> , and they all are standing in this way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed i was going to work at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for a <unk> here .
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is from the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty big number of you who were all <unk> in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
many of them are <unk> by faces and so on .
somewhere there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady who was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and now we &apos;re going to collect data from all -- from the whole collective memory of how visual the earth looks like -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photos are being connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
look at this as the sequel of stephen <unk> at virtual earth .
and this is something that is growing up through complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to use the user as a bigger one .
their own photos are going to be <unk> , which has been a different person .
and of course , regardless of all of these are the enormous rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which are not only being received by <unk> or <unk> and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand them right ? their software allows for a certain point , within the next years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are basically connected to each other ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to make them <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the amount of <unk> information that many of these images have .
how if you do a <unk> for images where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what &apos;s going on .
but how if the picture connected them to all their images ?
then the scale of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that makes it really enormously . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you very much .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope , in <unk> with other things you &apos;ve heard . and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed these things .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the <unk> of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , sense , a <unk> premise for human beings .
if people have freedom , each one of us is for themselves to do things that maximize our general public and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good people have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply , i think it would not come to the sense of question it .
and it &apos;s also <unk> in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big one .
i just want to tell you something about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> business for a <unk> <unk> -- speaker , <unk> , radio , radio , <unk> , and in this one electronics business , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can put on <unk> million different <unk> plants from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have any phone of the phone , as long as he came from <unk> bell .
they <unk> her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . <unk> .
one consequence was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business now , you can be sure you &apos;re going to get it soon .
and what it does is it brings people into business and ask this question .
now , do you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more <unk> than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a have these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they promote us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice , as this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t get identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re going to reinvent ourselves as often as we want .
that means that every day you wake up the morning , you have to decide what one kind of person wants to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one and they could <unk> them as fast as they could , and then get so fast children like they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did earlier .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
should i get married later ? should i just have children , or do i have a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions independent of that , whether it means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to get to you and get not a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl <unk> , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day of every place on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the way that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions in terms of work , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our children in football , and we have our mobile phone for a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably has on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in which we &apos;re going to ask our child in the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is that certainly your experience of the <unk> of your child is very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live here now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about that , so i &apos;m going to get something bad about that .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> way , is that he &apos;s getting <unk> instead of free .
with so many options that you can choose , people have very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> of <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> , took the participation for two percent .
they offer 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees take part than if she only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> who are for choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you should choose to take it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , it never comes .
because they don &apos;t participation until 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes that the world looks like this .
they really want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s forever , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or the wrong <unk> .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the result of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more possibilities there are , the easier it &apos;s to regret everything that &apos;s a <unk> for the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has done a big point today tomorrow by telling how much the way we grade things is based on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that you <unk> , which makes you less happy with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of <unk> .
very expensive real time .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn , &quot; man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thoughts that he missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot on day .
<unk> <unk> happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities for choice , the more attractive properties of these choices will be considered in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s going to make a statement about it now , and maybe even slowly doing things about it .
but one more important point that he does is , who you decide for a thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re doing .
third , <unk> of expectations .
this is what i met when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all time .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , easily <unk> or <unk> ?
do you want to put buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut the bottom , <unk> , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all of these damn jeans and <unk> , and i &apos;ll say the business -- and i say the truth -- the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt bad was to have all these available options , my expectations for what &apos;s going on for a good few jeans , go up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were just in a way .
when they came to 100 species , <unk> , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was a <unk> compared to what i expected .
the add of possibilities in the life of people inevitably inevitably increase the expectations of people about how well these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this . because if you would , you didn &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was better than everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world in which we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best you can hope to hope is as good as you expect them .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all come from -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married to a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always like a bad thing .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the <unk> , and you ask why who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is : you know .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so if people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re <unk> themselves .
clinical depression in the industrial world in the last generation .
and so the <unk> is that , generally , it goes better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a choice is better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice better than a little choice .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time to improve our public choice .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule , the thing about thinking , which is what all of these choices allow in the industrialized societies , is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of them whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things that i talk about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is steve <unk> told you yesterday about how that expensive and hard to <unk> car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry about the worse that we are there .
if something of what the people of our society can allow us to make decisions about the societies in which people would have moved to little choice , wouldn &apos;t just improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , an advanced person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything about this . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the view of the fish that knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis , and they reduce happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost <unk> security -- perhaps also for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor of <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new lives and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many biologists tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years , and when we sequenced that <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world is the digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate life , or whether we can create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes , from the 500 or something that is here .
so we decided that the only way in the front is that chromosome in fact that this chromosome is actually able to produce , which allows us to vary the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we create a chromosome ?
does it allow chemistry to create these really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life was exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has become very slow , but still increased , and our last point would be going on an exponential curve .
we started about 15 years ago .
it took a few years to start with a <unk> review before we made the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with digital information , the genome <unk> x <unk> .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little bits , and we made a <unk> , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
and the viral particles were then <unk> from the cells and came back and killed germs .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were doing this model right .
they laughed more than she does here .
so we think that this is a situation where the software can actually build their own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , it was a mistake of a mistake per 10,000 base base .
we found 30 mistakes in the <unk> . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
a part of design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to <unk> with other <unk> to build smaller <unk> to build these together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of these letters -- these letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
first of all , we signed up .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we made the pieces so we could just break them off with enzymes , and there are enzymes that fix these things and bring it together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with <unk> with the five to the <unk> letters , put these together together to make <unk> , to put them together and to <unk> .
in each step , we created these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with about 100,000 pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. <unk> , and it goes beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular molecular biology , and so we used other mechanisms to do it .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> that is used by biology to repair dna that can bring together these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million wheel of radiation .
you see the upper field , that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything came together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move on looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve just used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , and yeast makes it automatically <unk> together .
this is not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see with the <unk> .
these are footage of a long period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is about <unk> letters in <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever been created by people .
it &apos;s got a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we could print it with a <unk> of 10 and without spaces , it would include <unk> pages , just to <unk> this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you do it in <unk> like we are , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but just recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and can activate these .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here &apos;s the end , but we tried to get the process further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who imagine evolution when a gene has changed at a time , has missed a lot from biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> , which are actually <unk> dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell was none ; the chromosomes that we put in .
it was <unk> in the cell , and realized the other chromosome as foreign material <unk> it , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all of the characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve gone through .
it may sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can , by moving the <unk> , change things pretty dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve said that we might be able to create a new form of <unk> explosion in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in <unk> .
today , three people on this planet , for every year in the year , has been <unk> ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to provide a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . these are hundreds of millions of <unk> on the day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from all the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of this .
we &apos;re in first line , in the first line , to the limits of biological reality and to those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or create these processes to make <unk> or drugs , new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> for <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a recording of actually <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re working with , which you actually sit down and design new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly how their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of the fourth generation .
they recently saw corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon coming out of a lot higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way biology will have a big impact without more increase in the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as <unk> , and that &apos;s why we work on cells that go .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with <unk> of the fourth generation , and this is in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , at almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane from the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study if we can use <unk> co2 , which could just be made to <unk> , <unk> the co2 into the fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but now we &apos;re working on using the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think this can be changed by making <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future could possibly look like with changes today , can accelerate today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we are light years from improving people . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that , thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been seen -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create conditions that exist less than a <unk> second after the beginning of the universe -- and this to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the wide , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction that you see the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine was going on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge amounts of <unk> in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is the entire track of the lhc , and then <unk> with one part of the lhc to make a rain from particles into the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was going to create the largest <unk> , or this as somebody went to the google side and found the front page as well .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific economy .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wires -- these golden wires .
these wires lead to <unk> <unk> when the machine is running on <unk> .
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you put them very far down , they &apos;ll be called the <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can get the tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
this is how the wires <unk> and <unk> <unk> suddenly met <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is still <unk> when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and moved to about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we also did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way again .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and let &apos;s expect first data in june or july , and put our journey on , to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a kind of <unk> , these accidents have a debate about the value of science and <unk> on the limits . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but of course , it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that will ever change .
however , recent things have happened in my life and my career that has brought me to rethink my terms of this work completely .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as i would be <unk> .
seriously -- <unk> <unk> !
for example , they &apos;re all worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear you &apos;re never going to <unk> this success ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re <unk> your whole life and never try to create a book that anybody in the world are interested in ? never again ? <unk> .
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
people said , &quot; you don &apos;t fear fear , don &apos;t you succeed ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you kill the humiliation of a <unk> ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re going to <unk> your life for your life and never get it out , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter <unk> of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;m afraid of a lot more things that nobody would see .
like algae -- and other things like algae .
but if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about that for recently , and ask me , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it obvious that from someone should be expected , he was afraid to do the work that he feels like to do ?
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative companies that they make us insecure about the common state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , who was asked if he was afraid to be chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come out , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemist did not get the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
we were writers , but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to have this reputation to be mentally incredibly unstable .
all you need to do is look at the bitter <unk> from really great heads from the 20th century , who died young and often by their own hand .
and even the ones that didn &apos;t actually have a <unk> , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said short of his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books has killed me a little bit further .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
the question that i want to ask every one of you today is this idea for you all about it ?
do you feel so much ? because with just one centimeter , i feel not sure about this notion .
i think they were <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , to start to start this dark path of the guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m just in my career .
this is -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;m going to write from the world from the world as the work that came from the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s probably very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone can get to start with nine o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink gin , and i don &apos;t want it .
i would rather continue to do these work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the <unk> , i seem to be able to continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
and somehow i have to find out of a way of writing a safe distance to real distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction will be on the writing .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that comes from a distant , unknown source of people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity , <unk> <unk> .
by socrates , he believed that he would have had a <unk> that <unk> him away from a distance .
the <unk> had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind <unk> a <unk> genius .
this is great . the <unk> didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist &apos;s artist was protected in certain things , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t have to look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work is <unk> -- not completely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was <unk> .
so people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational <unk> , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this a genius -- instead of what he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations for success .
i think that this <unk> <unk> has <unk> our artists of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eradicate the <unk> of 500 years of <unk> , not just killed in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would <unk> really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people , <unk> and <unk> on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything else i &apos;ve heard when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- as everybody knows , who ever tried to do something -- so in other words : actually everybody here -- not always acting sensible .
in fact , sometimes he can feel really <unk> .
she said it was like a <unk> train out of air .
that would be <unk> over the country .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the <unk> .
she knew that in a moment , she could only do one of them , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> run like the devil .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget that -- she said that there were moments in which they missed it .
she caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in this opportunity , poem came <unk> and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought , &quot; this is incredible -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on . &quot;
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to be able to work , i have to stand up every day and sweat , <unk> and really uncomfortable .
but even i &apos;m in my <unk> , sometimes this thing has been <unk> .
and i guess many of you also have done this .
even i had to work or ideas that are <unk> from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we relate to losing our minds in relation to our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this can be tom <unk> . i was allowed to interview him some years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist who tried to <unk> these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him and doing with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he went on to los angeles one day in los angeles , and there changed everything for him .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no <unk> .
so he begins to rise with these old <unk> in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be followed by this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t create it .
but instead of getting panic , he just listened to it .
he finished all the <unk> , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , <unk> sorry , can you not see that i &apos;m going to drive car ?
and i look like i think as a song , i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment when i can take care of you .
if not , <unk> today , somebody else .
go and <unk> cohen <unk> .
his whole <unk> of <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was still as dark as the dark .
it could give a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing , which was not very tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it &apos;s saved me once again .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i reminded me how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried .
so i raised my view from the manuscript , and i talked to my comment on a empty corner of the room .
i spoke loud : <unk> listen , you know , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to show up here and <unk> your percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a little bit of a <unk> that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of this , it &apos;s like following , and centuries ago , in the deserts of <unk> , people were <unk> to <unk> with holy dances and music that were stopped for hours -- until dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this performance in your life again .
it was like <unk> the time and the dancers of a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything came together .
and suddenly he never appeared to be human .
it was <unk> from inside and down from the bottom , and everything is <unk> through a <unk> fire .
as something happened at the time , people knew what that was . they called it his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
if an artist in spain has done something <unk> , something magical , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> <unk> , there it is : a <unk> look at god .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wake up even , and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> of god in itself .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never come back to these heights .
and maybe again , someone &apos;s name will never call god &apos;s name when he turns . but what does he want to start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> when they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence come from them .
if you might believe that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life that will be passed on to someone else if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security in the last months , while i was working on the book , which will soon appear -- as the dangerous , scary , powerful <unk> of my <unk> success .
what i have to say to myself all the time , if i &apos;m crazy about this , is : don &apos;t fear .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still going to be for your contribution to whatever he may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that &apos;s asked you on the side , you decide for a short moment to show a kind of miracle of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> .
and if not , dancing , dance , your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite all that .
i think that , and i feel like we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite all of this , just for you to have the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states , <unk> 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t <unk> very enough to the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick of ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which <unk> out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
this is a problem because warming has <unk> the frozen reason to the arctic ocean , where there are big amounts of carbon dioxide , which , if he <unk> , is done by microbes from methane .
compared to the whole amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , this amount could double when we cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane from itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter &apos;s university in alaska has traveled with another group to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat is warmer from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea sea level goes up here , it <unk> it into the sea .
these rivers take fast .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has now got an negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that came up with a couple of <unk> is particularly strong in the melt .
this is about 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , they see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the <unk> , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if they &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be most drinking .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in sierra leone was seen .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
these <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have grown in a really <unk> , and had never been <unk> before .
four times a lot in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of eastern pacific , from american continent western and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there is a <unk> decline in the ocean in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> groups , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken out in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars last <unk> to apply clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
for christmas , around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this was about christmas .
one of the ads in the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has started two campaigns to live .
this is one , part of her .
in <unk> , we see climate change as a serious danger to our business .
so we set it up to the top <unk> , a significant <unk> to get a <unk> on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that to you .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burn of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here changes everything .
look at it right now , this is today &apos;s clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red string , which connects these all , is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america : find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty <unk> , that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
<unk> america : it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far away , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you , at the time of their childhood , when they played with <unk> .
while they realized how to get out the hands and <unk> the hands that make <unk> and move , they actually learned to think about it and to understand problems with understanding things .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore the answer and developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : they &apos;re physically , why you can only move them out of the hands of your hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and consciousness for their movements , see each other , see each other and see the <unk> of our <unk> with them , then we can start to explore new and <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> , and if i put it in a direction , the video is going forward , if i <unk> it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them next to you , that makes your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you notice that also , and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and tendency .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data like color so that you do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
so if we cut it down , we can <unk> a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and results to see the results .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci number i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of time on every <unk> letter , and as you try to form words , they will test these over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and you have a new <unk> and new opportunity .
thank you .
these are some children who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and try it and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; make words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> on the bottom right .
it turns out he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the <unk> from the table that shows this character .
this is what he &apos;s making the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> , and put them next to it , he can interact the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have today to show it is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as sound , <unk> , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any pattern again .
and you <unk> them by just holding a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect him with a certain sound , and then it tends to hire him .
and then <unk> effects like speed and volume that you use on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start where we <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> , and put them in a series , extend it and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something <unk> .
and now i connect the filters with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate all of the sequence by <unk> the speed in one or other direction .
and now i &apos;m going to connect the filter yet to the bass , for some more expression .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s going on .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it on the front of it , but i can improvise ; they &apos;re <unk> or <unk> .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by <unk> the <unk> on the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which are better to fit in how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the way is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to the interaction with digital media , to bring information into our world , which corresponds to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m happy to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back a little bit , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with modern molecular molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working on the <unk> for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started to know , because i just wanted to know what i was doing , and i wanted to do it even in fact , what i &apos;ve learned in the university of theoretical .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to kind of get closer to the matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology in general is talking about general , biotechnology , everything you count on that , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and much more important is going to become more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like this whole genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
now there &apos;s craig venter in <unk> , trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
and then there are things that are completely understood in the life that most people are not aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash with 40 degrees of laundry , as well as <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from interest to this , on this technology , i &apos;m just going to continue to <unk> .
so what does this do ?
most people know most people know that from the <unk> .
computers , and then in the media , it will always be like that , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws out somewhere , and so on .
this is kind of very sad for the <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t really do what it actually started like , and what &apos;s going on there .
and that &apos;s , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also grown out of the internet .
and it &apos;s about making a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and it &apos;s been able to grow with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that makes all sorts of <unk> things .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can use it too , and so you can <unk> it too , so , and i found it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
it actually took <unk> eight really shape , which are these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe , and with cooperation in india , <unk> network , but now has members or active people all over the world .
but it &apos;s actually always about finding such a <unk> access , such a playful to deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more like a forum , where where you can wait and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of a <unk> , and there &apos;s also a little bit of a <unk> question .
and based on these networks that made the whole popular popular process , it has evolved as a scene that i &apos;d like to give you a long time .
here in the picture on the left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so in principle , a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit club , where everyone can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go there and just <unk> them up , and they put a lab up and look at what you can do if these <unk> are going on .
here on the left is a group in indonesia , <unk> , which is , you know , there &apos;s quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
they also engage in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in a pretty <unk> way .
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition at the subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s most young people , but the only thing that actually <unk> one is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and just <unk> to society and ask and ask , &quot; okay , what do you know what you want to do , are you interested in bringing you with this ?
so , okay , so to make biology now , you need some kind of material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you usually understand under a lab , these are kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely <unk> , just for <unk> , trained academics with ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each each one of each <unk> has actually developed technology as most <unk> , which is really like this .
and if you look at this premise with this premise , by example , brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , has then taken a <unk> , a <unk> and , yeah , so <unk> , and then <unk> bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s already got a soup of soup that he has left for long , has been done .
and i tried it in my lab home , trying to scale a little bit , and then i was bought so <unk> on ebay and made a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so it &apos;s like this / <unk> .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , which is , like , a kind of <unk> in the principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , well , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so there are people who are doing it at home , so much larger organizations , which are the more <unk> that they &apos;re going to do in a <unk> form .
and then there was also about that , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation , our basis ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;ve been working on a <unk> .
and that was pretty intuitive , so everyone has just got this wish , his , and what it &apos;s moving on , then it said .
there , i think , was done a very good code .
and we don &apos;t do that , but that &apos;s yeah , i think it &apos;s quite good , and people are really convinced of this .
and we actually tried to bring it back into the academic world , but there &apos;s somehow not there .
so , i think , in terms of <unk> , we &apos;re actually going to step further than the academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects are we going to do now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to make a so-called optical trap or optical <unk> .
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the laser , and then try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
so , another project that made out of the french group in paris , that worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he said , well , such a <unk> , so <unk> or something like that , so he &apos;s busy with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , that went .
and then the visitors in the room could go in in the room , put on this chair , sit on this helmet .
then they measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , they &apos;ve been looking at different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which has also been there with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , reproduce , <unk> , fragments that can be visible to them .
and the machines that make things like this are pretty expensive that you buy commercial , the cheapest go to <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
i think , somehow , six hundred dollars or something like that .
but in any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
a project that i had started recently was building a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two inches or so .
you invites <unk> to <unk> and then <unk> into these <unk> , and then i took it on <unk> , and then they put it on the light , and then they <unk> it .
so the device you see here is not working .
but this is my prototype of my prototype , which looked pretty wild like a branch , the thing on it , tied on , electronics on it and the pressure , and that was the pressure too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and i put it on it .
a <unk> , if you do the full amount of water with water , it has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about 40 to the <unk> bar about it .
and so you can speed up the particles very enough , and then they go into the <unk> .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros up or something , and it &apos;s like the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically possible .
so this is , at the moment , the <unk> of the scene just to increase this availability of technology and also expanding the information and the <unk> that more people can get involved in this .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a relatively little idea of it , and also no opportunity to make it really good .
because if you read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it even again or seen it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make good decisions in society as well as a society , you want to make good decisions in society , and you want to have access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it too , and understand to do it and understand it .
and this is then <unk> under the <unk> <unk> and citizen science .
so , as a citizen , you can be able to <unk> with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting , also , is that they are also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , i think there are less people , which are actually there .
so i know some of you who don &apos;t have <unk> .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
partly with these <unk> , these places are <unk> together .
and this is really in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has just started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are represented everywhere in the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to spread similar to us , and then they &apos;re also similar to connected , so that there are more people being involved in .
and i &apos;d all invite everybody to deal with it and also try and try it myself .
it &apos;s not so easy now , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get far too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we work in people ?
this is a question that moves me very much as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> , and all of the things in the area of user <unk> .
it &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and create it as a <unk> experience .
and i think that the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models of <unk> , so paradigm that have been <unk> in our biological memory of very , very long , and that we can just generate that just through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these <unk> , you know , that you actually get in the future , but in fact , the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
so what are <unk> models now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four <unk> , and i want to explain to you short .
in <unk> cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve done in the <unk> times .
in these <unk> models , we have basically natural relationship with virtuality .
that sounds basically unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;m going to prove to you by trying that you have a natural relationship with virtuality .
the second aspect is that since because of these <unk> models , we &apos;ve been able to do very , very , very <unk> , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language today .
and the third area , which explains actually itself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> by definition , which contains the denial of sound , and of course , what makes us feel normal today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
now , what about this with virtuality , which is actually the most fundamental thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they <unk> reality , and it &apos;s not with computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so , for example , we give us hard to show the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually do that all the time .
and this fortune to <unk> the virtual reality that people had needed in the <unk> times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , memory was playing .
in this head , knowledge became <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination , was also passed away .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can handle this so well .
and the interesting thing about this is if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what it is .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time , the person was <unk> and medium .
now , if you think about a piece of pieces .
what are media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about again .
<unk> tools of <unk> have been about stories .
<unk> , priest , so-called <unk> , were extra <unk> to preserve knowledge in stories .
and also today we depend very , very strong about stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to us , is still a year of <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child who has spent it to reach the most of his life to most of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on that we were sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s much further back , in the cultures of the <unk> times .
but for me , in the area of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have <unk> by a se in our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i &apos;ve brought you an example from the north american tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , somehow , to come from island to island to get food .
and they did this with what &apos;s called <unk> .
you may know that , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit about the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used that <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of areas could be recorded about songs .
which was the language of <unk> <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and over rhythm .
and these sound and the rhythm have shown that <unk> , the topography of a region , and that also allows you to be able to <unk> these songs and put it on the left and go back to the right and also move back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing that to come from the top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happens to this <unk> machine age .
we &apos;ve moved before in what &apos;s called <unk> .
what happens is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve changed the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god <unk> a way to <unk> .
virtuality has suddenly become alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
from the <unk> to the age of machine .
what has influence on our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> influence of the original cultures are .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> over the centuries of the centuries .
that means , instead of remember , we have a lot of common , far common pattern of memories of memories we can hang on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract <unk> language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing more in pictures of things not more in images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to doing things linear .
and we accepted the <unk> as the law , and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we are arrested for <unk> as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re going to go down this called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very well for science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , they bring us these possibilities back back to our skills again .
it &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to tell you a little bit about this short .
there are technical concepts like the <unk> reality , which means the extended reality .
so , of course , like that , of course , in the context of my talk , we can move physically in not existing , virtual worlds , just after the role model of the <unk> .
and other example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can react to a human being smart .
all of that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;m going to end up , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can get up for a short time , so you can talk about the two about the two .
and i brought this project as an example of what &apos;s going on in this <unk> , cognitive models .
all of this is a game , i have to say that .
which is , of course , extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , they &apos;re very likely to see that any people in front of some people have <unk> , or they play with any of those <unk> in the hand .
in any case , they do it in .
this is a game for outside .
and this is specifically thinking that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data of the <unk> that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to <unk> so much .
you can explain a lot better , there &apos;s more and more more behind it .
and that &apos;s why i discover a city by looking at where places were positive or negative .
and so from the city , i get a very different sight , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of city , and i get this kind of different , virtual map from a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is still a little explanation from what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with them .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is there to be a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to me instead .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s in there as well .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious about this .
yes , kids are curious about nature or should be curious , and designers too .
i &apos;m a designer of house , so i also work with the topic of curiosity , and how do we think about curiosity , and how do we lose curiosity , and why don &apos;t we lose curiosity , and we need to <unk> it again and so on .
so this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual existence as a <unk> .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in such a n of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a <unk> to the subject of natural user interface design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the whole designers that start with so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and that &apos;s where i just hold one of these little devices high , because things are going to be more intuitive , always natural , more natural , and that &apos;s where you have to look at it , which is actually for us people , of course , what is <unk> or intuitive .
so i &apos;ve been working with that when what is , of course or intuitive .
maybe again , you have to look back .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , this is what we &apos;re showing you now , we &apos;re now moving from the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern to <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
in the beginning , the <unk> <unk> through language .
that means that you &apos;ve found a common language , you could communicate with each other , has moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities have formed or villages , and it has created so <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
in fact , you had to learn , so no <unk> can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , and of course , of course .
that was then <unk> by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language began to <unk> in form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive , i &apos;ll start with and <unk> it in stone , and i &apos;m also <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a very different story than if there &apos;s one alive .
but <unk> , then , was going to move this writing as a <unk> , got a <unk> .
and then the next generation , where we &apos;re actually in the world today .
this is just through pressure and <unk> writing with <unk> and other people .
in the same time , it was the same thing that <unk> , where <unk> and other people said , are you really crazy when the people start reading , then the people want to join up , and that &apos;s completely <unk> .
so , of course , that confused us , because we see on one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
and these two worlds are just opening up , new and old .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at the guy , this new society , this <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
the topic of ecology is a global global .
not , if i think local green and the neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
this is , from the local village , actually a global village has become a global village , so of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so , as you knew at the time in the village , who has something to who and when , that &apos;s what happens today , about this extension of our self through these mobile <unk> on global level .
is it that we know global <unk> and more faster and better .
it was like this was happening according to the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been busy looking at it , which is , in fact , what &apos;s true for us , of course , what we may have also <unk> , which is also instinctively , so what makes the difference ?
because often people can do it , they can &apos;t do it , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not just change it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and then you &apos;re doing it , also , during school , with the topic of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , now i &apos;ll just look at the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
so how do we work when we go there ?
and what does mean , of course , , of course , , intuitive , and how work our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs has said , you know , a <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at detail when i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which means that in the core .
and looking at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many of them use the word , but you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
but i have to understand in the core , understand when it &apos;s going to understand information , when data is going out of information and information , again , so i know how i can actually do things like that , or , of course , <unk> .
and of course , design influence on perception .
so much natural , which is in a ship , but i look right , where is salt and pepper in there .
and if i say somebody , give me salt or <unk> , then he &apos;s going to think about it in the right , where what is in it .
and then , in the left , just intuitive access , and i hope that no sugar is in there , giving salt to the salt .
but also our perception itself , how <unk> they are .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just so big , and yet our perception is depending on what context we &apos;re doing .
anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should still work .
it &apos;s going to be there in my glasses .
so it &apos;s &quot; n circle . &quot;
a second circle starts to connect , certain similarities , or <unk> .
this is what you call <unk> or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for designers that are most important in the first <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> near , <unk> of the continuity and so on .
we often forget about the third third of the third year .
but this is an essential important component , if you want to make things very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting to see this .
so it sounds very trivial , but it &apos;s very exciting if you &apos;re getting closer and closer to this .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the front of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see it from the back to the front .
because they <unk> a assumption to the front of you seeing something that they recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re just going to see our vision before we see it coming back back to our <unk> , to say , okay .
i have this <unk> cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want , what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also there , and then it comes back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not going on the front , and he says , well , actually , i &apos;m going to look at it again and sure , if you see what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , like certain things are going on , and what happens for <unk> <unk> things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
this is what happens to the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now everyone is trying to see something like this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who knows what it is .
anybody see something certain ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a <unk> in there , then you know this .
you will never forget about it because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you can see the <unk> .
and further , now you &apos;ll see it always .
this is , i &apos;ve actually <unk> them now that they don &apos;t recognize more patterns like <unk> , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> within a very short time , to see this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of seeing , <unk> , looking .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the front that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes , then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but there &apos;s a lot of mass going on here in this <unk> mass .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds until i kind of <unk> out of the present in the <unk> , and then i can also bridge very well in <unk> , which i &apos;m going to do with him with three seconds .
it &apos;s got to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can <unk> very elegant <unk> , for example , on the computer , when i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the time you love in love .
that means that if you know this now , look at who you look like long , because i don &apos;t make any <unk> for what &apos;s going on .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions we have .
that means that this first impression is happening in a fast fast speed of how we perceive things .
and how we see things also look at what we &apos;re looking for , and how we &apos;re going to protect ourselves against our environment , so that we can think about it so much .
of course , designers don &apos;t just engage with the topic of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but , of course , , of course , with the topic of <unk> .
so , like a person with certain things <unk> .
there &apos;s even more practical functions , so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> where i know exactly where i really have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there a little bit of a <unk> , where don &apos;t you know what &apos;s going on , so <unk> money out of money , although it &apos;s not so practical ?
there are more to the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we also think of as a designer of course .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the topic , which , of course , also <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> always means , how can i make a certain goal very quickly , or how can a user in a particular <unk> can be effective , efficient and <unk> .
that &apos;s what the norm is to say .
how can i do something like this ?
can i use that directly or need i , &quot; n manual , or do i need a training for the training . &quot;
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i do it just differently , and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you also have to understand that .
in fact , intuitive <unk> is not only since apple &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , if i want to make a <unk> technology for people .
why ?
because in the rule , we are through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , for example , five times faster at average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make something of the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re going to have to go home four hours rather than home , but your employer , or anybody , you know , just like he &apos;s busy with the four hours .
but i want to say that for us , of course , this is a <unk> , also to make certain things .
so if we go back to the area of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> interface that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , which now has been working with a <unk> model or mental model like software <unk> , which have been a idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
this has been a lot more <unk> , but , of course , it &apos;s too much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;ve made a lot of the behavior in a lot more often the behavior as it looks like this .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
i think that it always looks like a <unk> for success , just the <unk> will be an app .
and then if i take a step into this natural user interface , where i have a voice , by language , by <unk> , by gesture , and not more by mouse and <unk> , things have to control things , then i &apos;m even faster and more .
but again , that leads me back to the point , when do things actually get more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look , what does this mean by view of the <unk> , when is it really intuitive ?
and that , for us people , is always intuitive , if i have to think very little about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s really easy to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we look at existing <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a <unk> .
that is , i can actually transmit this an intuitive , human <unk> on a software and make the software significantly <unk> .
and of course , the question , of course , is what &apos;s actually like the <unk> <unk> of us people , and now i &apos;ve already told it .
this is what &apos;s called <unk> .
this uses every one of us and <unk> is an acronym , and it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that makes each of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s basically intuitive or partly instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works at the world at young and old , and is used by us all the time , without which most people knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to the <unk> of us ever in activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often than the day .
i can now be <unk> by this mental <unk> , <unk> , informed , <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar as the metaphor of the <unk> , but not more , a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> metaphor .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
it &apos;s just eaten every single cake .
<unk> : so now i &apos;m going to <unk> with the object , can <unk> again , <unk> .
i &apos;m going to get the whole picture , and i can then filter this up and say , just show me all the thing for chocolate .
and again , one interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so all of those who are here and curious , in fact , are people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now , i &apos;m going to talk about that , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they give the + you give scale to about two gram of phosphorus , and every day you have to get two gram of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only <unk> as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we actually don &apos;t make phosphorus and give it a phosphorus .
it &apos;s amazing that we &apos;re going to deal with something like this , which is actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not like that .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus and already for two years , and now through the <unk> world , there &apos;s a lot more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> <unk> of uranium has been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , <unk> less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , it only hits three times more five times .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about it from <unk> to <unk> , our whole earth is going to be used or later a <unk> .
it &apos;s about thinking about the <unk> of <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the <unk> is stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons per hectare , or <unk> .
that means we lose about five times five times more than new educated .
we can , of course , look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> are <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , the <unk> are going to be bigger .
this is all in the <unk> .
yeah ?
one baby needs about six thousand <unk> .
we could , of course , reduce that to 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this will be balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is <unk> with the pigs to get the solid components of it .
the people on the urine of the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , right ?
traditionally we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you get the people that if you exist to people , if you say it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel you say , if you <unk> a human life , you <unk> the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we people .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody may see termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that ants weigh much more than we are .
and because they are physically working much harder than us , because they live only three to six months , they are in their weight , in the energy consumption , some 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree before ?
yeah ?
one single ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be <unk> than trees , yes ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
fortunately , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> on trees .
there are still six billion trees in the <unk> .
you &apos;ve heard about it a little bit of <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be <unk> than trees .
and where you see , even in something like <unk> , the <unk> <unk> agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back into cycles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all call it that allow us to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , in terms of <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing brazil in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
right directly , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take the waste out of it .
in china , one of the <unk> today is called <unk> , which is , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always stupid to get our nutrients back .
this is , the whole western <unk> <unk> that the city has always been taken , but the farmers never got a bit back .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to cities , and cities had to continue to get their nutrients further .
all the western rich are always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat , in china , you expect to eat as long as you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat it , not to the <unk> .
this is , you can see on the internet , how you can get the nutrients back .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas is back over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be a little bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is <unk> , of course , but the facilities are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can just <unk> them .
that means the <unk> will go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been <unk> .
they could just <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then the plant would be <unk> over years .
don &apos;t happen instead .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people to be a little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus in .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you write on germany , in germany , for all the treatment of the treatment , which is in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can do a little bit of help on this .
because the <unk> plant could best get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it really works .
we have used in holland now over three years .
the dutch government explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need this total .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> worldwide .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and the oil will replace us by other energy centers .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
this is not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , in fact , what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , of course you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if your wife is sad when you &apos;ve got them <unk> , and you get to 50 <unk> .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eating about six <unk> three pounds during their life .
that &apos;s what it is .
this is not scientifically accurate because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to happen .
but a <unk> , even with these lighting , i can tell you , it &apos;s completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better and burn it a little bit better and do it with it and to lose all the materials for these cycles , but first to ask , how do you make cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yeah ?
if i put them on dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yeah ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about saving , to avoid , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say to people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , the throw is right , right ?
every place where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you create <unk> again .
but the wrong stuff .
if you <unk> the wrong stuff , you have a <unk> .
as we think from north .
there &apos;s every footprint on the <unk> .
if you walk , yes , every footprint is destroyed the ground .
because the ground is going to die of mosses , and the wind and the water <unk> the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint is any footprint that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re saying sustainability sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , <unk> , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s kind of like , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow are <unk> out of the car , like this .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> system , which is with room temperature , a liquid .
they can <unk> them where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build up everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so they &apos;re going through the throw in biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all of them should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they just use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they need to be so much that they &apos;re going in biological systems .
the things that are only used are in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
very direct advertising , not for the company <unk> by se , but for that you help do this business , to make these products successful .
because we &apos;re not making things more free .
yeah ?
so , if i <unk> them to eat and say , this is free of <unk> , so it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we put in what &apos;s in there .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in there .
but everything that &apos;s in is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the <unk> on the <unk> , and the <unk> can go in biological cycles , yes ?
all of it is <unk> of it .
and if we can do it , of course , for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole industry industry .
and this is half of all the <unk> around the world that will be caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help them , ask them to people .
hey , <unk> , do you really be serious ?
because they &apos;ve already changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit about it .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that &apos;s what it is .
so we can do things now that if you <unk> , if you <unk> , you can do it in biological cycles .
technical cycles is the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , in fact , that &apos;s done to go back into the cycle .
so that , so in every store you can <unk> the things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> of the <unk> ?
if you &apos;re at the moment , garbage is .
all of these <unk> are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there it is on the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
yeah ?
alone , if you take these <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> and the powder , to plant trees with it .
so the baby is <unk> for the whole life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can still invent everything again .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working with it , and you can all get involved in this .
there &apos;s extra society on it , <unk> , where everybody can join .
so no more saving , <unk> , avoid , reduce , no <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i &apos;m written , as a <unk> , as a <unk> , in english , in english <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of the written notes in <unk> music .
in fact , from the german to translate into english , it can require more knowledge , because if you do it by poetry or to poetry , it can be about poetry .
it &apos;s very alien , but it &apos;s for <unk> , which we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i only had the written notes .
they certainly think that the composer has <unk> all the things that he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same , or <unk> , like a <unk> , if also very seemingly <unk> , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the <unk> just to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
this is , the <unk> has got to translate this <unk> to the <unk> in another , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
so today i want to translate to you what i could translate to musical <unk> , so <unk> , even in a conscious language .
so basically a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it again to english , it would be equivalent to me in translation of the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as similar as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to just learn to learn just notes and to push the keys on the piano or the right place on a <unk> .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of letters is only when you can see the language .
and so you need to take for the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also <unk> , if you learn it for the <unk> , just passive , or you can also talk active until the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts like a <unk> .
after you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to <unk> in the emergence of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composer itself .
you study the works that he wrote before and after .
you compare it .
the <unk> , the <unk> , to write it .
how and what did he feel ?
how were his lives of the lives of the society and politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but with time , you also have a rich white knowledge of the composer that you play with times , and it &apos;s going to be more easier to feel and feel in him .
the composer is always going to be more to a friend with which you live together .
his cause to write the piece is getting more and more to my personal cause of playing it .
now , the notes are all different than a <unk> record of the composer , but just a framework , i &apos;m going to turn this framework in order to <unk> it with sense and meaning .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> , which could mean these notes .
now for me and for the composers , and what you could mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense of it because i feel it myself , because it comes from my now personally .
it has to be in here for me and now <unk> , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
again , it &apos;s a very happy concert , when i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long in advance , to experience the new .
as you &apos;ve always experienced a happy new day , although always with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , work , so i also have the same piece in the same piece again .
i &apos;ve become a day older who change seasons , my pulse goes down at night than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer that the sound goes back back than home .
i suppose the audience &apos;s breathing , aware or unconscious .
all of this affects me , and all of that affects my experience with the composition .
so wonderful , when i stand up with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and there &apos;s an answer to this answer with a response .
it &apos;s exciting because then things happen that we don &apos;t have to do so much , and what you can &apos;t see .
it makes great fun to make music in this way , and when the audience has experienced how the music communicate alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , like in this moment .
i can &apos;t play like this in 20 years today .
and i &apos;m going to have more experience experience than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to put a lot more <unk> on my palette and emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m also going to have some <unk> <unk> , but for a new <unk> .
there &apos;s a nice concrete example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> to my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great happiness to meet him very early , with 13 years old , and so i was in my high school in my school classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses again and played the last of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> is for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
there he was <unk> , and he said , right ?
that has to be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , at 17 , you have dreams , but not a major memories .
i play this piece every few years today , and it &apos;s always changed for me , although no only note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
this is an example of a very different area . <unk> painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s too different <unk> , with <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as they looked at it at this moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is like this .
now , i &apos;ve been even older than chopin was at the age of <unk> when he wrote the piece .
it &apos;s lived just <unk> years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even if i mean to be able to <unk> them .
to keep <unk> , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection right to him .
especially if he had died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need to have about the same time for spoken spoken language .
well , often the <unk> is that you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning reading before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes on the notes on the instrument .
if all the finger in time and right like it is moving in the notes , then they come out of sounds like music .
if the <unk> happens , the students get the <unk> piece .
you can &apos;t talk about interpretation about the interpretation of the interpretation .
well , there &apos;s the front line , which is a quick piece .
<unk> , slow .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
this is what most people know here .
but even if you put that data out , it still remains something technical .
and yet , it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget about <unk> .
and that is , to make music on the instrument , doing their own musical stuff and feel there before you .
that &apos;s what the singing is .
a child who doesn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not do it by itself .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experience and idea of music , so it &apos;s about another possibility , about an instrument , to sound sound .
people who never sing , so they never felt directly with the own body , as it is to form a sound .
it &apos;s a phrase with his own breath .
and the instrument of music is the extension of our body .
our vocal voice to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music even though it &apos;s going to be boring .
no longer needed to whistle or singing .
every music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re going to be <unk> with music all the time .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing it ?
the question i can &apos;t sing you can &apos;t sing , a because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if you can &apos;t yet get it , or learn how to hire these little muscles that are using the vocal voice , really used .
that &apos;s where you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it up to you that you &apos;re <unk> .
and i ask , how <unk> philosophers was this diagnosis ?
did you get a <unk> or a <unk> , how to say it beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to have a <unk> to do it as well .
but what i &apos;d like to regret now is because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can even <unk> them .
well , you see , in all cases , nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , &quot; but you can say , you know , do you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give up to classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it and tell you whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is to <unk> them or too cute .
tell what they feel .
and in time , they &apos;re also going to be <unk> , and you want to get some more <unk> there or taste fine differences .
why do i challenge now from my audience that it &apos;s also going to listen to active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of art you never look at has no force .
the food that was used by a chef or a chef and a chef , and it has to be eaten , and not just looked at or recipes .
so please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where adults are doing active music or at least active music , it &apos;s growing a child , then it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you now play me in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a <unk> , instead of a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step into a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written in a hundred and a hundred and three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have <unk> .
there was no piano going on at the time as a instrument .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited when he had had the <unk> possibilities of today &apos;s modern <unk> .
i can have the <unk> that the stream had to sound on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
also , from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has rejected an orchestra as a <unk> .
that &apos;s why the composers rely on us <unk> that invent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> what they &apos;ve been thinking about in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m doing today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy ?
have you ever been <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a <unk> .
when i come , with my little v <unk> , and i &apos;m going to go down , this feeling comes up .
i &apos;ll shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need for the n big ?
it &apos;s lost half of his value in the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford my n of little car ?
and then , immediately , it falls to me , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great method to make these uncomfortable feelings like envy .
you can do that in words like revenge or <unk> or something like that .
i want to explain to you something about this mechanism today or something that &apos;s likely to be familiar with ourselves .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard , if people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them .
one of the lie is that the liars even don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to check that it &apos;s very different in sense .
he &apos;s just <unk> them and not themselves .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about are doing it to make them deceive themselves .
they need these lie , to get a <unk> , to get a <unk> upright .
they can bring them less easy , yes , <unk> or <unk> .
they need time .
this time , an anecdote that you may know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once has a woman <unk> .
this woman has then <unk> , the portrait would not even see similar .
picasso says , wait for it .
it will always be more similar .
in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important these lie is , and how much time they need to learn something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship with lying .
the artist shares them something , and especially this lady you don &apos;t see if it just looks just in the mirror .
the artist shares them in a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of art again .
then this awkward feeling , it may not look similar to them , and it will always be more similar to them .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it turns out again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility of this real fact is , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true <unk> .
but we should just be familiar with a woman that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here it is necessary , which is what we understand from <unk> <unk> , and again .
we need this lie to this lie that <unk> us without that we can &apos;t survive .
we don &apos;t only have in the art , in the <unk> , but also in science such a great lie .
and there is this story of the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the ancestry of people .
the person should be <unk> by the monkeys , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she <unk> her up to her man and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true what charles there write . &quot;
the person should have <unk> by the monkeys or a common ancestors .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent the people to get out of it .
why do we need to prevent people coming out of something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live with these <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
we need to prevent people to know about things , especially when they are true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism looks down and like the traces that he leaves that leads to something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to share another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told them about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to particularly like him , because he &apos;s got a tendency to <unk> .
and she asked him , what is your dad ?
and that &apos;s where he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s nothing wrong here .
i told my wife , whenever a human being used in a moral <unk> , that &apos;s because we should try to replace it by the <unk> .
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they feel that it &apos;s the real truth behind <unk> .
this is a little <unk> , but it &apos;s not interested in <unk> .
it &apos;s interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no clubs , where we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
there he was signed up .
and <unk> , you also don &apos;t say his teacher , you don &apos;t like to put fire somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire &apos;s going to go after it .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of getting rid of the risks that others can only create if they just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these <unk> , in the <unk> , knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
and so , just like that words , which we also use in the language of the politically correct <unk> .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know when we say that , social relationships are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to show things in a society that should work .
so i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
after the logic of this deception , these <unk> , the willingness , a different reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s guilty to spread out outside .
so , i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead , what many of you know and some of you appreciate that very few don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so intellectual , says about dave .
and from this soul , they think that they somehow , in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , is called it in the latin , the <unk> , present .
and if this <unk> is then <unk> about the people , then it &apos;s filled with mind , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive it as something that should necessarily be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic , which we experience this happiness through a lie of a lie to our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
you know , <unk> , you know , from school .
now this is a <unk> that describes a logic .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need something logic , but also to lie to the willingness to lie .
because that &apos;s why you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences come before .
the first sentence is , <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was particularly <unk> with him .
a third sentence that immediately shows in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , is dead , and it can &apos;t argue .
and here you are .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , these are logical correct .
and i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s true .
i can argue everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something about it .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s as if the opposite of the first sentence has been proven and accepted .
because , in fact , we &apos;d have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which just uses that two sentences are correct , and a third <unk> that looks like this , as if he would have something to do with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we do that as if it was actually impossible without being able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things on different examples .
in the present , in the present , we have a very modern example , which is over and over again , <unk> .
so you have to have another <unk> topic , a <unk> from philosophy , present .
that &apos;s what it has to do to go back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> that was called <unk> <unk> , and after that , the <unk> <unk> named <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you place the exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what <unk> he should go to first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how the <unk> showed up .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you bring another example , so if you immediately make a bit bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing at all .
so automatically he &apos;s going on the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , from the larger pile that you &apos;re wearing immediately , you also have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> here in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> for brain science .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which is called a wolf , and he says , in fact , he says , &quot; wolf <unk> , &quot; there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence , and you can say , if wolf has <unk> right , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the newspaper , that &apos;s what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , can &apos;t be <unk> for his actions and claims to responsibility , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s <unk> .
again , they have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove to you if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of first sentence is wrong , as you need to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do it if you want to do anything even if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to do people happy , practice the courage to lie .
do you do that for example , if you see a human being , you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
they can &apos;t call them , and then it would be a little political .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now , immediately you get one , for granted , you can see these <unk> , you can &apos;t prove it .
and now you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy doing it , you know that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled them .
because he has led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t <unk> themselves .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in being able to prove to themselves the need to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the kind of shift in the <unk> , you experience the <unk> of lying .
and if you even have a possibility again to feel this <unk> in other people , they do it because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember that way in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed me to wonder if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and he asked me whether i wanted to give a talk here and give my idea .
i &apos;ve got to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it out , it was hard to talk about my idea at first .
and i may be able to imagine my <unk> that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum whole , many ideas .
and i went to the middle of the <unk> for berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were all <unk> at the time , and the <unk> was called <unk> .
the name is <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either built or <unk> .
but something like the n <unk> , from the kind of a hundred watts from the square meter out , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful to the <unk> that he <unk> the word again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because all the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the <unk> years .
there was so much that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you found the evil .
place in <unk> , but that was called <unk> , and made wind and solar energy , and there i started in the middle of the 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very excited about because many , many beautiful expressions of what i &apos;ve been working on .
i worked in the collective , 11 years in the collective , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s busy with <unk> .
and i got it to <unk> <unk> , and then we got together with friends i &apos;ve become <unk> of the company <unk> , which was then <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of one of the largest <unk> in the world .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , as you come to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where could you be able to make sense of memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have renewables today of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
that &apos;s not going to go technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> each other , the system begins to fail .
i always tell politicians when they <unk> our facility in <unk> .
and they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen in the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the <unk> that was <unk> , the first contacts with the island started , look just through .
as big as you have to be a battery , you have to be like an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year about a hundred <unk> electric performance on <unk> <unk> on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power stations , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , which is going on , is taken by <unk> because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
it &apos;s a <unk> box .
and then it looks like this .
in that , always three of the <unk> , two will always wait .
yeah , this is what it looks like down the bottom , which is the load .
we also got very accurate data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system , which can only be <unk> in small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the <unk> will be <unk> , and the wind , the sun is using the load , so that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go about 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the <unk> .
this is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables are sort of able to take the entire net .
and of course , you can only do that if you &apos;re able to do it in any way in any way .
it doesn &apos;t have any one in the world .
so this is in a little style , so you can also use your <unk> on a little <unk> car .
people always ask me , what do you think you &apos;re doing in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to <unk> several of these <unk> , and you should build a net , it &apos;s going to be very complicated .
this is going to be a fuel cell , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or <unk> , it will be then .
they need to go more to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know , what about a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far will you get there ?
and then they did a whole lot of simulation .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , like the <unk> , when the <unk> goes up five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would all have to be done ?
have <unk> with investors , i was looking for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to build one in order to build a society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , is that we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of <unk> , and also not <unk> a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> on the island , is what we think is great .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of build the electrical sense of the island of the island of one to three .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , of course , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , it &apos;s been <unk> , and it &apos;s been <unk> , and it &apos;s been developed by the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
she has a megawatts of performance , and it can bring six hours to this performance , and this is the battery we kind of have <unk> <unk> .
and then they set them up .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the wires , sort of <unk> the <unk> on the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see this again , again , the <unk> , again , the whole , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since <unk> was the hall then done , until today , it &apos;s sort of <unk> everything that was done between the individual system of electronics , software that we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define us as a company that is only between the topic of battery and the topic of the net and all between .
you need to communicate , of course , to the battery , you have to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing about the theme is that in this island , it &apos;s basically all the <unk> that we &apos;re going to get in the problems that we &apos;re going to get when we &apos;re going to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , like , is going to go back and <unk> , <unk> , as it should go , for example , on the island , for example , we have <unk> to 30 percent , so we &apos;re <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is going to give us <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , because you can manage the load of load .
that means if you &apos;re over 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can <unk> through the n of <unk> , you can do that by <unk> , yes , you should do that in any case , the percentage of <unk> , but you will never be able to get rid of memory .
and this is the message of the message .
and so many people come and look at this , just because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the <unk> , you don &apos;t have any more of these rotating mass that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just taken out of <unk> masses of big electricity , where the wave is always like around europe .
we look in this web , you see the 50 <unk> , and if it &apos;s going to be <unk> nine <unk> , we &apos;re going to start a couple of <unk> <unk> , and then again , a little bit of <unk> steam , and then we come up again .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you <unk> that somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that more , these <unk> mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> two milliseconds of battery to this big battery .
and you can see there are the enormous <unk> there .
and the message is , we have to give up to these rotating crowds , if we sort of have our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to get at all .
then we have to break down our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> is just called the power power to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> because we don &apos;t have any , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going .
and we just try to tell you that you can break down the capacity , the <unk> capacity , to break down , by getting <unk> memory into the net .
and fortunately , fortunately , there is a whole lot of studies .
and in that purpose , people always come and look at our <unk> , like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can make a piece of the future there .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years .
doesn &apos;t go , is <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve got all out of it , don &apos;t see it .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going out that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity for <unk> stores all over the world .
just simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that , in the last two years , i &apos;ve been experienced in the last two years that scientists have on my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million <unk> now , also , to <unk> <unk> <unk> now to the german net .
that &apos;s going to happen in april .
so you can also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and just from this <unk> to yes , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do these <unk> , they &apos;re doing <unk> , they have a very small net , and it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with our <unk> .
but the question is , but it &apos;s very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent of some fossil or <unk> <unk> that are going to be <unk> somewhere around the world and become <unk> to you , then you &apos;re an island .
then they just use what &apos;s there in the sun and the wind there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said they &apos;re using solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and this is what we &apos;re going to do , and the talk about <unk> <unk> , that you can get a collective and use solar energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you .
as steve <unk> , <unk> of los angeles times , one day by the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who played on a violin , which had only two strings .
nathaniel left <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless man at the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in <unk> disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he talked to a very <unk> and <unk> sound on <unk> <unk> and hillary clinton and about how the warrior would never create it in the baseball world <unk> , and all because of the <unk> passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email where he was interested in <unk> for <unk> .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel had <unk> a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electric and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
and in the same way , in the same way , he was <unk> , when we started with our first class in <unk> disney hall , and he had lost this <unk> of <unk> in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke and about how somebody wanted to poison somebody in the sleep .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , a total change was going on .
it was as if it was under the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical response that makes my game be my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> turned into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing some clips of <unk> , and then asked me to end them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started from stream on beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a <unk> knowledge about music , but with her also a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i could only know from my colleagues in <unk> in los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was from this <unk> , <unk> man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for <unk> , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him , his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the creature of art .
this is the reason we make music : so we have something that is in us all , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is all about us , and moving , inspired and united .
what <unk> set up is that it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him who realized his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel music , whether in the <unk> disney hall , <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i got a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole <unk> .
i hope you excuse me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was <unk> in <unk> after the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like you &apos;re going to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the ceo of the company called and asked if i could give you a event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this incredible problem has become for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have <unk> the ocean as we beat forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they are collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
many arguments . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . it &apos;s a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company finally trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the public service for the company .
let &apos;s call it it .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing up so far out of the ocean that you don &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added up , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and this night i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask .
now , i &apos;m going to take a few people in the company . nobody could give me a <unk> answer , until i finally <unk> with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s also call him .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i &apos;ve actually <unk> <unk> from this fish because , i swear to god that <unk> fish after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i ate it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came to the table with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good after it became <unk> ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least on the way they and i understand below .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> on what was basically the <unk> .
they did that by <unk> the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they <unk> water out of the country , and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and green was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought green the country .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company , the ecological destruction completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and this density , gray march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the <unk> and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> keeps a <unk> .
this is where he comes up with a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of <unk> .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of <unk> that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> spent the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and it falls in more talking about rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , like that .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how is it that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm that didn &apos;t feed their animals ?
at the moment , it was like a director of a <unk> would require a <unk> .
and we moved around the corner , and we offered the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> , a literally <unk> carpet so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well , last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s been the largest and one of the most important private <unk> in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is that a good <unk> isn &apos;t the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the <unk> .
so the <unk> of the belly is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , these <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they &apos;re flying back and back .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , are you flying back to the farm , and then you fly there for 240 miles back at night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was just <unk> a song from whitney <unk> .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them <unk> . i don &apos;t like them <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to try it in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t taste it at all .
she liked sweet and pure as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a swam .
she &apos;s the last <unk> before something coming into the body .
it &apos;s developed over evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added to it , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that &apos;s measuring their success is the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have <unk> , he <unk> it , because the water that flows through this farm comes from the river <unk> .
it &apos;s a river that leads all of the things that are rivers that tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and that leaves is the water clean than how it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , like romantic always , is also <unk> .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , actually taste good .
but for a lot of people that &apos;s a little bit more radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you argue that these are the things that tell the future good food , someone somewhere around and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not , because we &apos;ve already produced enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> fertilizers in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because you &apos;ve been based on the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
<unk> grain in <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken in fish , and the whole time , they just wondered , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the <unk> . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that <unk> fast energy capital that allow that production to be .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile country , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , but not by <unk> and nets , but through fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never has a really good job for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that <unk> on two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
companies that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , <unk> instead of <unk> , companies that grow <unk> rather than just intense , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , people are most active and they &apos;re over here at <unk> .
we can move on one step further , and we <unk> the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on to the age of age , we say 40 years or younger , we see accidents are the main cause that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s going to see that this is particularly true of men .
so you can see that the view of information and data in this way is reminded of swimming in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data , why don &apos;t we also do it for content ?
now what we have here is the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; who &apos;s ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they like to test it after my talk in their <unk> .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong fan , so i click on this , and i &apos;m going to give me all the spending that <unk> armstrong will mention .
now , if i want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i &apos;m going to look at everything with the topic ? &quot;
so i go back , and i <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to look for it or not just <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further with something like a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and reduce it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short <unk> and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately we get a sense of the issues that are in wikipedia at the beginning of the world .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i chose &apos; government , i know that the <unk> that are most about the time of <unk> &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a insight that is not in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you go back a step and look at this .
looking at a certain of these summaries , i can then go into the theme of time <unk> &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everybody together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and throw a look at all ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re using the net the first time as if it &apos;s actually a net , not only from side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else what could be a little surprise .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step and jump right into a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s important because you can just look through websites in this way , all the <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in in a certain place of time in my course .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration that i gave up to this .
and i can sort of look at everything i &apos;ve looked at today .
and if i look at a step again and look at everything , i can <unk> my course , maybe after my <unk> , here , i was looking for <unk> , here to <unk> , or here to live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over again , and every time it makes a big picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we talk about the curse of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
if we can do that , then this last source is going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from that .
and if we know knowledge , maybe we can actually pull out <unk> .
so i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> part of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus to school every day a hour per road .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> that <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , and in a <unk> way , my deep <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the kinds of exploration .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because at the time in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques <unk> came into our living room with his amazing shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder we could never imagine before .
and that would be very good at that <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s neither video games with these <unk> movies that were still in the media landscape in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all have that . when we read a book when we were children , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> them on the canvas in our heads .
my reaction to that was to draw and paint from aliens , aliens worlds , robots , <unk> and all that kind of thing .
in the <unk> , i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i was hiding in the <unk> textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and something interesting happened , which was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never get a alien world with a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on the earth , and she was so fascinating and exotic like all the things i &apos;d ever imagined when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i decided to become diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand miles away from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t leave me with that .
i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , found out on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i only got two years later on face when we moved to california .
since the last 40 years that have been <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , as we can &apos;t really imagine .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , very opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love is holding the ocean on the same intensity than ever .
when i got a job as a adult , it was the <unk> .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner drive to tell stories with my need to create images .
when i was a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so on .
so films were the way to bring images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i <unk> to me from the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could connect my <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> .
so , it &apos;s sort of <unk> my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create such a kind of liquid <unk> -- that we <unk> on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what came out of this was the first <unk> <unk> that ever saw in a movie .
now , the film didn &apos;t make any money , and he just said to his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like <unk> from the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur <unk> &apos;s law , <unk> technology and magic are not different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that needs to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; <unk> 2 &quot; , my next film , a lot more .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was just on the way that this effect was going to happen .
and it worked . we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we had a little more money on the film with the film .
from these two experiences , a very new world was achieved , a very new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company together with my good friend <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> at the time , and she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the idea of this company was to skip the stage of analog processes with visual <unk> etc . and begin to start with digital <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did , and we made a benefit for a while , for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually founded the company -- to slow down .
but the bar got very beautiful back , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to be able to do that .
so i moved this and made this other movie about the big ship , which is going .
and i sold that as &quot; <unk> and julia on a ship , &quot; it was a <unk> scale of magnitude , a passionate movie .
but basically , i wanted to actually <unk> the titanic <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced you , by saying , &quot; we go to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back again that the own imagination can create reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really <unk> me .
and the risk of that was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things .
and i realized how much that <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up into this capsule , you &apos;re going down into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is going to save if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as much as i would be in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of doing that with curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
so that was really <unk> me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood to the ice , and i &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we explored with <unk> .
we went back to the titanic end of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look down and look at the inner of the ship , which has never been done before .
no one has ever explored the inner of the <unk> . you haven &apos;t had any tools . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and look at <unk> , which is pretty similar to these <unk> , and i know that once the band played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> by the <unk> of the ship .
so i just <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically there in the <unk> of the titanic .
so the set of the set was an accurate copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
it made me realize this <unk> that you use such a <unk> , and so your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence , can be embarrassed .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a small view of what might happen in some decades , if you &apos;ve got <unk> to explore or do other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started to learn what we saw down there , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , which are like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help by <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a <unk> system , as we do .
and this is what you see next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was again the <unk> of my childhood .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went out that i took the <unk> with us into the deep sea .
what we did is , we were doing <unk> , but in fact , science , in fact , said , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , at the time , as a child , and the manifestation of reality .
in the course of this journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but now i think you certainly have to think , a director must have led to be a leader like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the <unk> . it &apos;s not <unk> .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on a towel on the beach somewhere .
i &apos;ve got all these films , this dome , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked for years for years , and sometimes we were at two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the alarm you have from each other , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain to each other .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you cook his team and make it in the return of the respect .
it really changed the dynamic .
so , i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we have been in a right family for a period of four and a half years .
it changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who thought we &apos;d really <unk> these <unk> and transported to the planet <unk> .
for me , it was more a <unk> way of doing my job , the real process that changed the result .
so what can we get out of all of this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the alarm of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
the other one &apos;s going to get others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and exploring , failure has to be an alternative , because there is a <unk> .
no important effort , the innovation called innovation , has been seen without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
this is the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my <unk> at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make the things we invent and give to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow about a lot of years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and things are going to change how it can &apos;t get their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for them .
it &apos;s also very important for them .
in fact , if you could just reduce that from one thing to the price , it would be more likely to be much at the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like the time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> went on the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in <unk> , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we meet a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 kills the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually pretty clear .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> and that makes <unk> , and where their other consequences are , there are some <unk> , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly <unk> about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> , and i said , &quot; do we really have to go down to close zero ?
isn &apos;t half the half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get near zero , temperature will continue to rise .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a <unk> truck that has to go under a three feet bridge , and then you can put it underneath it .
this is going to have to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re doing a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
everyone americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that reduce that to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly up .
only different economic changes actually influenced it , and we need to reduce the rise to the rise of rise and reduction to zero .
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers must come close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people live .
and it looks at nine billion <unk> who are going to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , <unk> and <unk> , we might be able to reduce that to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all about food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means to make these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
here we see a very basic service . are there home light so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , by other <unk> , through new ways in the <unk> , there are many services , their energy , some of the individual services , are going to reduce 90 percent .
in other services , like <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; em -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get a reduction in a factor three or maybe a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out the question is if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every <unk> of electricity today <unk> co2 , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonder .
usually , there &apos;s no <unk> that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just going wrong and some come out , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how could i really get that out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that <unk> the idea of people here ?
i reminded me last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i told me they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they don &apos;t get all of them .
we need solutions , either one or several of them have a <unk> scale and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are lots of directions in which people are looking for , i really see five that can afford these great demands .
i &apos;ve gone out <unk> , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
who can guarantee something , which literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard problem .
next : <unk> .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work on that .
i &apos;ve set up the last three of the five .
it &apos;s renewables as often as they are called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some <unk> .
one is the energy energy that these technologies make dramatically lower than the power of electricity .
these are <unk> , you talk about a lot of <unk> , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power plant .
also , these sources are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always get all the time .
that &apos;s why if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way of getting energy in times if it &apos;s not available .
so there are big <unk> . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t need just the technology , they have to deal with the risk that energy from where else comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to make these <unk> sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the world .
if you want to support 100 percent of that , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so many of you will say , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many who have been involved in this .
bill big has several companies under other companies called <unk> that have great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting possibilities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company that may surprise you , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> , <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts lie around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors .
instead of <unk> the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium will use gradually a little bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of column that &apos;s often called the <unk> wave reactor .
that really does solve the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that is burned on today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you make <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should we look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture . hopefully <unk> and concrete will be clean to there .
so to reach this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , have completely changed their <unk> .
the other note is whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key model of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , what should 2020 look like ?
there should be the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reduction on the way . the less we <unk> , the less that &apos;s going to be the <unk> , and also the temperature .
we need to track these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure that : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have a choice , &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy <unk> , &quot; the hot air . &quot;
they actually go through it and create a framework in which this can be talked about wide , because we need support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very important wish that we invent this technology .
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of things do i do ?
we need to use for more research programs .
if countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk about these <unk> , and you would be shocked by the ridiculous low funds that are spent on these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to <unk> dialogue and lead all the whole things , and also the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
the hard step is to build the first <unk> , another billion , the <unk> and the place that actually builds the first of them .
once the first one is done , when he &apos;s going to go like that , it &apos;s very clear , because the economy , the energy consumption , is so different than what we know about .
to understand that right : that means deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear <unk> , this <unk> , and then the process starts up , and it &apos;s going to work on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . today , you have to get the reactor always new , so there are many people and a lot of controls that can go wrong . this thing you can open and open stuff or <unk> . that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think about a column that buried it without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that gives itself a solution to waste .
<unk> : yeah . now what happens to the waste : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and you burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that exists already , which lies in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so that &apos;s what was a problem for these reactors , which is what we fill in our own , and that &apos;s going to reduce the <unk> dramatically during this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked about different people of this world over these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest in what really really does ?
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a version of a thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everyone who did a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , <unk> and probability really is to call something in life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is sort of the <unk> that has shown us the <unk> that we need to <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is going good , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be easy .
and luckily today , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , which , as if their approaches work , that works for their pilots to do that .
and it would be best if there were several , because then you could use a mixture .
in any case , we need a solution .
do the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know the work as good as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems hard , but maybe you &apos;ll say that about us .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we have to attract <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come to this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and it &apos;s a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is dealing with different techniques to <unk> warming , so that we would have 20 or 30 years longer given us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t just work on insurance because you might make a lazy , so you &apos;re going to eat , because you know one of them is going to save the <unk> .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for that to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptic is living in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can do at all , of which there is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is as similar as aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
the fact is that uncertainty should worry about us .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than you do today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
underneath , other things should not suffer .
you get to big <unk> , and here you can disagree with reasonable people when you have something that &apos;s not economically , and try to fund that , for me , most of the waste is most waste .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> , and you &apos;re just funded the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very expensive .
if the <unk> you get , a very high <unk> , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
for the lower two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about it .
and his new <unk> is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research talk more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be connected because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to bring it out .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little that will support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all people here when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> has to build the greatest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti sauce , about three feet of tape , about three feet of <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because people are going to work very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
usually , most people start <unk> themselves in the task .
you talk about it , you think about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they <unk> and put spaghetti out .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time more , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it very carefully on the top , step back and say &quot; <unk> ! &quot; you admire your work .
but then what happens , almost always , is that the <unk> is going to be &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> will make the whole thing bend and <unk> .
there are a series of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> than others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and actually produce <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and under the best are fresh <unk> of <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how is this ? why ? what about these ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the children invest time in the boss of the spaghetti of the spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what makes it different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a lot of opportunity to fix <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt , kids get directly feedback what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance with working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average of most is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers make something more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceo is about average . but here it will be interesting .
if you put a <unk> <unk> on the team , you &apos;re going to have a lot better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they lead the process , they understand him .
and this team that <unk> and looking at work is going to improve the performance of the team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six who have stable structures .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought , we &apos;re going to get the <unk> right now .
so i offered a <unk> cost of software for the winner .
what did you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone had built a <unk> construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we did this practice with the same students .
what did you think that happened ?
now , they understood the advantage of <unk> .
so it became the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;ll help digital tools and processes to help teams make cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or <unk> , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples from all the world , how people <unk> and <unk> the system .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , how our feelings and our do , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that needs to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to bring us to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do this as if we would have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in there .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and stay now .
and i ask me what they would choose because i often asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america addiction the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re drawn to the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that you ever have on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents were <unk> this number to 70 .
my parents are 80 to the <unk> .
so there should be better a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born today in delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of earth in a way , like no war ever managed .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we <unk> them . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases , the millions of us , are still threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method , to try and try to look if it works , whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are hungry every day to bed .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s going up very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t disappear from this chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is keeping me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me wake up at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress so much as now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable , like we can today .
people are <unk> in their faith , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will make it free .
and listen , everybody has a right to mind ; even a right to think of progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right to their own facts . &apos; &quot; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i needed a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article on <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at <unk> resistance , on resistance to what &apos;s going on at the end of the most effective activity in health care in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon i wrote an article about <unk> food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a certain kind of random kind of <unk> that was a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we rich , we go food , that &apos;s okay .
but that article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> , who did not make me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like people in this room .
and that brought me so confused ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress like we used to .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> of it .
we talk ironic about little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what reasons are that .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons of weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were always right . so be skeptical .
imagine asking you , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything as given .
but now it &apos;s : if you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that from the reason we live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> vaccine in connection .
very scary .
tons of studies have been done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we believe in , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents of a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
<unk> because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is down for <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
because here is someone <unk> ?
is one one in the audience who ever see somebody die in <unk> ?
not very often happening .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but <unk> times the world in the last year .
these are a lot of deaths from malnutrition , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like jenny <unk> can walk around and put messages from fear and <unk> of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just evolved with a couple of other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul <unk> and about vaccines , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public <unk> , it can &apos;t talk without armed <unk> .
he gets calls home at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children are going to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them away , get the diseases back , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we &apos;ve been <unk> in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in tuberculosis .
what about <unk> ? do we take that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i think i &apos;m a little bit <unk> .
no one has ever said that before .
she would not <unk> her child against <unk> . not a case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe tomorrow , someone in lagos was going to go into lagos in lagos , and it &apos;s going to los angeles , at the moment it &apos;s over ohio .
and in a few hours , he landed and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if he &apos;s not .
we love to <unk> ourselves in lying . we love that .
did you all take their vitamins today ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you <unk> .
i know you did that because half the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data makes it all the time .
they <unk> their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m very happy to tell you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us that can afford it .
so we go away from that , and where do we go ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to do that .
and i have all sorts of little <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people shout to me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some <unk> who want to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where faith and magic replace evidence and science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people around because he was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than <unk> drugs , which we know are going to stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that are worse than each other from this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this ridiculous fight between the <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . she has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch of <unk> , every <unk> , was changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11 years .
and some of it works , and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re <unk> <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all that is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works , and sometimes he works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real dead , and it keeps millions of people from <unk> .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that eats half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatoes .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all that right now .
and then people could eat the food and would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t be hungry , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes <unk> . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> here , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to get the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that as far as we do , we do something guilty that we think we don &apos;t want to be guilty about , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of us , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might like to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
all right . i want to do that every case .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we come up in the time machine and we &apos;re going to go to the future , we will be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is to me , that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
a deception will be true because somebody sees it so much .
so to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s , in every <unk> of children .
i even learned it from the <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hand like this .
i push my elbow back .
and to ensure that nothing in my nose disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to <unk> my wrist here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving anything , as long as i get here , nothing can go into my elbow or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the knife will <unk> through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting in its place so that i can shake it without that the knife is going to fall .
nothing goes into my nose , or it comes out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> young children who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , although it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
you probably know many of you here in the room of this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing in my nose disappears or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that it &apos;s the actual secret of the illusion .
in the moment , where i put my hand out of them so you see them from the back , this finger is moving here , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone sitting back in the back who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> , the finger changes his position .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held in there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing is that , by the way , by <unk> me , it &apos;s hidden through this movement that the finger <unk> up again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can demonstrate to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does it have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really <unk> me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and that turns out , if you provide an <unk> in form of a white pill , in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give to <unk> , for example , changing in a smaller pill , and color this blue and shape a letter to it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of them are <unk> ... it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really <unk> me .
but it turns out it &apos;s not all .
if you take <unk> , it &apos;s even more effective than pills .
a colored capsule that &apos;s at the end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
it &apos;s a role that makes a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... also , the <unk> play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you put into a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a <unk> system .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem so good like the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem so good like a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and nothing about that has some really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our belief that we can make a stronger effect on us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look at it really .
we know from this study that you have to get to the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long <unk> . she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to get them a little bit more <unk> .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin , and i &apos;ll take it through them until you put it on the other side again .
if you look bad -- if you <unk> easy -- i showed that a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman has become almost <unk> .
so i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re very clear , you &apos;re going to look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first <unk> part here in the back .
you can see it the same way , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat begins , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other side again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and <unk> itself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people back in the back says , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are now coming in .
let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> it .
sorry . if you get bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
okay , let me give you a little blood for them .
yeah , here it is .
usually i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no injuries .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;ll just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re very happy . thank you very much .
everybody talks today about happiness today .
i had a few people count the number of books that were published in the title of &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive <unk> that somehow can make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act of this cognitive fall .
this is for <unk> , which is thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so confused as any other .
the first of these are a <unk> , complexity <unk> .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning on which we can reduce it , but in large and all of this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is an idea of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy being in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is <unk> , and that &apos;s the sad fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without the meaning of it .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and then he added on , really pretty emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it <unk> was the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was <unk> with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what it really says is that we might think about us and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt you if i put them here ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and <unk> the two , is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we make us tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experience , is a story .
and let &apos;s start <unk> with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who have a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail . she &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report on their pain all 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a is a much worse <unk> of the <unk> than patient b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is very clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the worse thing is that where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing in total ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the <unk> self , b clearly had a worse time .
this will lead the patient suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
what does a story look like ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory gives us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
which is a story of <unk> , changes , significant moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , it <unk> the end .
well , the <unk> self lives his lives constantly .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , somehow they get the impression that they should count that what happens during those moments of the <unk> is our life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re on this world .
and as we use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
from the <unk> self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first one , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
it doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> holiday is hardly better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self from a <unk> self . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which sort of <unk> the <unk> self through experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we do vacation that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re going to go on holiday in the service of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that for the dominance of the <unk> itself is given .
and i probably have from my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are only a year and a half hours .
there seems to be a dissonance .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all their images are <unk> , and you get a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
why we pick up the <unk> that we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two species itself .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they are all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea from the happiness of the <unk> self over time .
if you ask the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s how happy or happy the person is when this person thinks about her life .
very different term .
everybody who doesn &apos;t separate these terms is the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , which blew the exploration of happiness long in the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and happiness of the <unk> self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years we started learning about the happiness of the two species itself .
and the main lesson we have , i think , learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s living as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> itself .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what happiness happiness is like .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly happy to be with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two kinds of self , you &apos;ll end up doing very different things at the end .
the conclusion from what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really think of happiness as a <unk> for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think people have to be happier in california if you say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is we say , in climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens with people who are moving to california in hope , to be happier .
well , your <unk> self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to remember how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think of well-being , and i hope that i give you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we were talking about a few weeks ago , they mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this <unk> survey .
is this something that you can do with us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness of the <unk> itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly happy , the poorer they are .
that &apos;s where we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t raise a <unk> , but the lack of money is certainly <unk> , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be on the head of everything we believe , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , in general , would take a <unk> like the seriously , and would make policy based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i believe there &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening , and in other countries they &apos;re happening .
people are aware that they should think about happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
as you can raise happiness , it &apos;s very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , they were <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics are .
well , it seems to me that this topic is going to be at least the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane <unk> . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been building <unk> now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , how to save it in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time with play bigger and <unk> games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a lot too much time if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that time dramatically .
i calculated that it took time to 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty accurate why i think games are so vital for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he built a camera before the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you can get some of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , very deep in the solve of a really difficult problem .
if you do , you see some <unk> here , which are up to the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who stands at the edge of what &apos;s called a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . good . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so very positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do something like this . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just standing in front of a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces on the whole world , if we take the barriers to the next century , the face of people who are on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we actually see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad at <unk> .
this is an graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better at play than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as playing .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s heard .
we get more in <unk> . i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration with each other .
and in reality , if we fail , when we come up on obstacles we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings when we play games , in play , they don &apos;t just exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , to think , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play in reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that are going to be able to do the epic <unk> in <unk> .
so first of all , if you get in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are ready to <unk> them a <unk> mission and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in play , right ?
so you can do that .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , so they have to work hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you &apos;re <unk> . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish up your epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in the real life , that feeling that there are lots of employees ready in a <unk> staff .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have heard about level high , and <unk> and &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have one : + 1 : a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get in the true life of this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at any time at the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we prefer to spend our whole time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> had spent <unk> millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go upright .
so the first <unk> primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend on play , it &apos;s just going to make sense when you think about the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate , because it turns out that by using this whole time on play , we actually change what we &apos;re able to do as people .
we develop in collaborative thinking , thank you very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s what i think .
if you look at this interesting statistics that recently was published by a researchers at carnegie mellon university : the average young man from today in a country with strong <unk> spends 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st of age .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours are the exact <unk> that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the high school of high school -- if you &apos;re never missing .
so , here we have a complete <unk> to learn how to learn what it means to be a good player , like everything you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know the theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of any issue until the 21st of age , we will become <unk> .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most famous people in the world are doing .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players who are doing good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have had a human potential for it before .
so many people now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> , saving energy and working on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , with players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is for us to do these games .
here are the four things i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , a barrier to <unk> , together with belief that we have a global hope for success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth trying to try and do it right now .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody spend time with us that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same goal and stay with the <unk> .
so the <unk> can grow the <unk> , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the <unk> of <unk> play 22 hours a week , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard as if we relax or do nothing .
we know that we &apos;re going to work as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it , part awe of <unk> missions to be <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to go back to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in every other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who lead to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individual .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he &apos;s studying why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to witness not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so , it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit <unk> .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in <unk> than in the real life .
they can make stronger social bonds in play in the real life than in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so he says , well , it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i &apos;m just going to agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that <unk> 2,500 years .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> , there were <unk> .
and that was sort of the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek <unk> <unk> , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> games , games , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> invented as a famine .
we thought there was such a great famine , the king of <unk> decided to have a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , a national strategy ; one day you would eat , and the next day you would play .
and they would be so powerful in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and surrounded us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived so 18 years for this famine by eating on a day and playing on the next day .
so , i think we &apos;re going to put games today .
we put games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , which is not satisfying in real life , and we get us what we need to play out of play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years of <unk> , famine didn &apos;t better , so the king decided to <unk> a last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two <unk> .
they played a <unk> , and the winner were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and made a search for a new home , and they just had so many people back , how there were food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of a area where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> shows that the <unk> that came up later the roman empire is the same dna like the old <unk> .
so scientists recently come to the notion that <unk> &apos;s crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> , which took almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be voices .
maybe you actually saved your people through play by having 18 years of games in games , and then they had these <unk> , and so much of the play , they &apos;ve saved the whole civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing , in 1994 , warcraft .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they were playing <unk> for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should <unk> that half of us spend an hour per day with play until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in play ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been asking for my work in the last years at the institute for the future .
we &apos;ve got this flag in our office in <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to press how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then we &apos;re going to allow people to do this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to give us <unk> wins , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very short three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get people &apos;s latest <unk> in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 . and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how they were going to survive , and most of our players have <unk> the behavior in the game .
so for the next <unk> game , we put a bigger , higher goal than just <unk> .
we developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
what &apos;s going to happen is the computation of a <unk> that people have only left for 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the call to player , to sign , we made almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s the &quot; <unk> , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only together , you can save the world .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we get on the third of march : it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world &apos;s award for <unk> , by 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in very sub-saharan africa , and we invite them to learn social development .
we have a comic book . we have a level high for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and genius .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , who benefit from having their own social company to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope that you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make close social nets , <unk> and desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like that , and play with me like this .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s play the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that was noticed a couple of months ago in writing a article for <unk> wired .
i &apos;ve always been on writing for my <unk> , but i was finished with the <unk> of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been <unk> in my life that the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read them the post .
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i was just starting with elementary school and started building my own sense outside of my family &apos;s family , and form it in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at the time .
if i would take this point seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person , whose life can be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to celebrate for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately asked me the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected me to give you a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words are <unk> under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; good &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the <unk> , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big force because what you &apos;re going to do loud is <unk> .
so , what do we really want to <unk> -- a disabled people or a powerful person ?
in fact , a human being had to call <unk> as a child , they could <unk> them and <unk> them up .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them doors ?
a person who opened the doors to me was my pediatrician &apos;s <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t say correct , so he was always called dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was always carrying very colorful flies , and was just created for the work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
and imagine that , even though , as a <unk> child , i negotiate with dr. <unk> , and i tried to stop that practice , <unk> without success .
and if you create it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i ask myself today , how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls have shaped my sense of self , and i could imagine being able to see me as one of nature to strong , powerful and <unk> human .
this is just one example of many , as adults can transform the imagination of a child .
but as the <unk> evidence shows out of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we all wish we &apos;d all wish : to allow every single person to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social change that was caused by a technological change in many cases .
so maybe this technological change is clear because ever that there was always a different truth , which is that every human human society can give a very <unk> and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus and is .
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course , we &apos;re affected by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to <unk> to get better at our lives .
<unk> are just in our lives .
and i &apos;m running out to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s always in me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact on any of the impact of a human being .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and each person is different about it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come up with <unk> or not , but how we realize it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preserve <unk> , but they also prepare for it to get sure .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : for one of the medical fact that you have to be <unk> , and you have to have social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to put up with me is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
maybe the current concept , which is just looking at what is broken , and how we fix it , for every single one a larger disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t treat a human , and not all its forces and opportunities and recognize and recognize it , we can also make it in addition to the natural fight , which you might have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , there &apos;s a connection .
we should not <unk> these <unk> times or <unk> , and we should not try to avoid them , and we should get them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing in the <unk> opportunity .
it might be more important to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but that we are open for it , to hug them , to put them on <unk> , to use a <unk> , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can create it as a kind of natural , <unk> , useful and useful , and we don &apos;t feel like that through their presence so much .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , showed up to something very true in human character .
i would use it so <unk> : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the <unk> of his kind , but the ones that can adapt best .
from conflict , creativity creates creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , from the fight of the human mind , is determined to turn to conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re going to do , if we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly what the sense of <unk> , a perception of it , is a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are on a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s say , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really want to learn this poor , gray person , if you really would have it ?
i don &apos;t think so .
<unk> found that we &apos;ve always needed people from the members of our society to be useful and afford a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals of 60,000 years ago , older people and people had carried with heavy physical injuries , and that might happen because the experience of life in the <unk> of these people was valuable .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there before a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee <unk> . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t want to remember me .
when i first saw her , i got them from the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it made a click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i knew only from stories of my mother about this day , because i , of course , very typical , came to my birthday two weeks too late .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> of my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were <unk> after you , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to get the bad news .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical that factor can be for the quality of life .
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone is dealing with it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of time , if you asked me at the age of 15 , if i had my prostheses against legs from meat and bone , i would have no second <unk> .
i really wanted to be normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is happening because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could also happen because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened the doors instead of looking at people who <unk> me or wanted to <unk> me .
look , it really takes a human being shown to you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own , inner forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and open for someone in a critical moment , you have a door for these people , and they &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open themselves doors .
the real meaning of <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means making something that is in one , <unk> the potential .
again , what potential is we going to want to share with you ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , a case case was done , and then <unk> turned into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided to notes .
and the a student will be tested <unk> harder , and they get better teachers and so forth .
they then gave me a <unk> , <unk> , &quot; very good , &quot; and they were told that they were very smart , and after these three months , they were actually written <unk> .
and of course , it <unk> one of the heart that vice versa , the <unk> said , they &apos;re just enough .
and it was just the same time after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- besides the students who had <unk> school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that the <unk> and the students are enough , and they have taught them something to do and treat them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that has been broken , no hope , no more hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more <unk> that we have our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability of imagination .
but if we can do it to support the human mind , continue to hope , even and other people around us , to find out and be curious and <unk> , then we put our forces really positive .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that through few changes of their genes , could have better memory -- more precise , more closely and faster .
or want to be more powerful , more powerful , more power .
would you like to become more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of which is always <unk> to more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
some of them . probably about so many people like the creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would decide for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to <unk> it as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all <unk> ?
or is it possible maybe ?
evolution is a <unk> topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor at the subject .
the big <unk> in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian church church , wrote a paper with the title &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this : is it just over the past , or is it about the future ?
is it good for others , or is it true to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we <unk> from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , there might be 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some were coming and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of life of life , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
is it clear that we can be able to use it and make the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human <unk> , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s <unk> <unk> from what &apos;s coming out of the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria already , you know that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times a lot .
i mean , do you think if antonio <unk> asks for your sense of self , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you could just wish without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of unintended , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help by <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we determined to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment better ?
in this huge <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is just very short on earth ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s what we were .
this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope that d ate it like .
now , when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i asked , something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , every cell <unk> , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue in both <unk> .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms came up , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is in the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction that <unk> the genome , the rest of the body is <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the death rate of the death of our body in evolution is happening in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who was reading his show in the &apos; 90s in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
in front of him is a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal in the way that it was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily <unk> , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health after a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the copying of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i develop <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to fall into the ocean .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood , the <unk> of all of the expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to reach it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily seem to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily <unk> the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the best .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and because of the hot smoke , the hot smoke would survive , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum of <unk> fish in the consequence , yet they were able to make a <unk> environment there .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons for this is that we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and would have been removed from the population .
and second , as a species , we have a species that <unk> our environment so that we did it that they adapt to us right and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and <unk> and mix to us so much that they can &apos;t tell that isolation is , for evolution , to <unk> .
one second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional way , of course , from the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution are slow down slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is , if we are <unk> by a species , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and scary opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led by us as a <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptation to the bodies that would cure and prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic change to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or eliminate the risk of the risk of the risk or the <unk> ?
would you not want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can get a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available for everybody .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that produces the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection of themselves , but also to serve the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine against flu that has been grown into the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , there will be much more possible .
so imagine just two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the <unk> and <unk> or the fresh <unk> egg to give your kids a better chance for a <unk> life -- <unk> diabetes , <unk> the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can allow change to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt goodbye <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> that are going to allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the properties that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires a 100,000 years , and we can <unk> it in a thousand years -- and maybe even at the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be able to deal with it .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful that is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different qualities that we want to have for some of us , and not for others from us ?
are we going to be a society that is <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to meet .
and most of all , we &apos;re ever going to be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in good , like in evil , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
now , i want you to imagine something like a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one , which helps to get up and go back and go .
we call this robot <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and that will increase their speed and help them keep their balance .
this is actually the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- to join together and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who are wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to <unk> -- or the human being universal <unk> .
soldier : i can carry 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , for a lot of hours .
his flexible design allows you to go deep down to <unk> and do highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re far as far as we &apos;re going to imagine this device , this new <unk> device in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our look at the <unk> , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who have estimated in the world in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , which are in the height of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- from fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , the number that multiplied .
and so quite the only option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or about other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since he had to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility in mobility .
so let me introduce you to <unk> , which is carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> age 19 years ago , which has no longer run for 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is attached to your back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their <unk> , as well as their <unk> , which are moving forward in this pretty <unk> and very natural landscape .
i was 24 years old , and i was in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> , <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not for a long time , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been <unk> me since to learn to climb again , to climb , and even drive with the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all <unk> , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a boss of the <unk> of a nonprofit organization called robin <unk> .
if i don &apos;t get to poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteers , <unk> the fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , in the volunteers , you have to support a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to get <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers for the <unk> , so i had pretty good opportunities in that .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> and find out what would be our tasks .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the <unk> who certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> and barefoot under a screen out in the <unk> rain while her house was flames .
the other volunteers who got just a little bit ago -- let &apos;s call it <unk> luther -- got to the <unk> , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who was now able to tell people about the rest of his life , that he went into a <unk> house to save a living creature , only because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next one .
the <unk> <unk> me up .
he said , &quot; <unk> , you need to go to the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get this woman to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back down , where i met my <unk> and my beloved dog .
we put our value out from the outside , where , not surprising , that got much more attention than i did .
a few weeks later , the <unk> received a letter of the <unk> , where they <unk> for the brave use of saving their house .
one of all the measurements of kindness : someone had even brought her a couple of shoes .
both in my job in robin <unk> as well as a voluntary fireman , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in a big scale , but i also see the act of charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this space in this room and see people who have either achieved a <unk> success , or on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life of another until you get your first million .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
use them in a <unk> , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day we will offer a chance to save life &apos;s life , but every day we give us the opportunity to change one .
so they &apos;re going on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of human history .
a place where women are going to lead the <unk> with sex , hello , and play the game -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your <unk> .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees of great , fear of <unk> guys are led , the <unk> of <unk> females are led .
they really came up with what was going on , because this leads to a very <unk> society that deadly violence has not been seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under primates .
they live in the deep <unk> of the <unk> , and the observation is just hard to get available .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the location of a violent argument that has been <unk> for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also threatened the survival of bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of <unk> lead that you could not even fill a <unk> with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees <unk> .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead war , &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules such conflicts and social <unk> .
i don &apos;t say that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life of the bonobos are made of more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , it &apos;s fundamental to play with the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
this is what we learn and the rules of the game .
game increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> , which is <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and male in a <unk> .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you put him in the eggs . &quot;
just i think it likes to like him , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are spread , both in bonobos and in people .
but the game is a <unk> game .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are calm down , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think that &apos;s exactly how you play ourselves alone , and we <unk> boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and the unexpected <unk> that we form are the real <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insight that bonobos give us our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges , through bigger creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , game is our <unk> .
to adapt successful at a <unk> world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life isn &apos;t made out of teeth and claws alone .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem appropriate , play may be at the <unk> .
and so my <unk> , let &apos;s let us hug this gift of evolution and play together while we &apos;re going to <unk> creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in the middle 1979 , at the same day , at exactly the same moment , every <unk> of a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> of a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine the whole time , you will not listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in one case , the <unk> is wearing a y <unk> that hits the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the <unk> carries a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both <unk> .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
at most of my activities , i have two <unk> .
under a hat , i &apos;m working with the story of anatomy .
i studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people <unk> with anatomy -- that human body , animal body -- how they <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about body .
the other hat i was wearing in my work is the activist as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as a <unk> lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often i worked with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not the male or female standard .
in one case , maybe you have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> that we all have at the stage of <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the <unk> are <unk> at stage testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a consequence , the body evolved more of the typical female course .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s most often until they reach puberty and grow their breasts and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until someone comes to it , that &apos;s something different .
and they make a couple of tests , and they find that they rather than <unk> and womb , in reality , is <unk> in itself and that they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for really male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , like me -- i believe in a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we talk about <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was given more <unk> than a woman who was born with <unk> and had a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be distributed over the whole range .
he had an extreme form of an <unk> <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> was so powerful that they basically created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male came up , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody could see anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he <unk> out that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes develop something that is called <unk> , which is <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- be <unk> or <unk> twins , is <unk> -- surgeons often have been adapted to the norm , not because that would be for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they have often made different kinds of surgical surgeries are because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain <unk> expression of a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is called a female identity ; to be a black person , is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this awful little idea .
and if we are faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture about <unk> .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born that two people are in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement at the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender has been asked by the <unk> world war in berlin .
many journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what test are you going to do to tell us if <unk> &apos;s female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test here .
now , we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t pull the line between male and female , or between male and <unk> and female and <unk> , we are the ones that say that the line of line , of course .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out as much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
in our observation , we have all sorts of <unk> areas .
so , for example , we go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in common .
what do we want to start with the fact that we are only different from a few <unk> ?
as we continue to move our science further , we &apos;re increasingly going to be in a zone of <unk> , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories we had probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
one of the areas where we see this in <unk> , in our today culture , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body for people , so that he &apos;s a different right than the <unk> life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to never have been so hard to fight with the question when somebody was dead .
they only gave someone a spring under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if they didn &apos;t move further , you buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we take people to take organs , and we &apos;re trying to put them into other people .
and as a result , we <unk> to the fight with the really difficult question when somebody &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have more so simple categories like this .
now , you could think that the whole collapse of categories someone like me would really make me happy .
i &apos;m political , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , it makes me <unk> .
and it makes me <unk> in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i first have to have a <unk> that i &apos;m a big fan of the <unk> .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in what they did , i &apos;m going to look at all the few years to look at the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening to <unk> with the <unk> .
the <unk> were out of my view of the original <unk> activists , so that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for a lot of us .
as you all remember , our <unk> <unk> the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy based on a very simple concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to have this political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather for father to son and so on .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> this idea and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people have been created on the same way .
they <unk> the play field and decided that <unk> saw the common <unk> , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk> together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time the science was growing .
if you look at the story of the <unk> , a lot of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations for a lot , and <unk> things , like a <unk> concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the independence of the <unk> , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to say who we are .
and as part of that , they made a concept that was about <unk> common .
and so they have prepared for a really wonderful way for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years ?
and women <unk> that successful .
next , the successful civil rights movement came where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of skin color , which are <unk> to <unk> similarities , <unk> differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing at <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all of the common similarities , we need to start to ask why we maintain certain <unk> .
well , you know , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish for example , not the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to give their consent to sex or married .
so there are some <unk> <unk> that make sense of me , and we think that we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they make sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures that <unk> both middle 1979 in the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> was born , so she was born in june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , is born to the <unk> , so he was born on a march 1980 .
just because mary was born three months of <unk> , they get all sorts of right three months before <unk> -- to have the right <unk> sex , to choose the right to drink that right .
<unk> must wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other <unk> about what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now be moved , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria yet , not in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same thing , the <unk> in all states , and to marry that right .
<unk> can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are problematic and <unk> in many ways .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science is doing such progress in the area of anatomy that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going on itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so let &apos;s pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people got into a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to marry a man that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and marry a woman that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story that i started telling you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the <unk> of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t tell people &quot; their skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you measure people because of their <unk> ?
i want to say that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships as some <unk> that i know .
so how do we take the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is a leader to make ideas about questions about democracy .
in our effort to make democracy , we made our thing right well , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
in fact , these kinds of things are not true of us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i was talking about a few years ago , which had a few <unk> twins with <unk> to separate them , partly to make a name .
i said to him , &quot; well , did you think of political <unk> , instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are without changing the state of will .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look like , or looked at if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radically radical , and i think that there could be different kinds of insights that are <unk> from different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people apply a <unk> .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i also was interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not each , but on average -- more often complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable in the group are vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and so if we think about it , we have an interesting situation about us .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , i asked one of my <unk> who knew my interest on feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it &apos;s still doing -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what <unk> female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the ultimate question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> about gender , that &apos;s why feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so that &apos;s how much i thought there could be something <unk> on feminism .
it &apos;s supposed to be , there could be something , on average , that female brains of male different are different what makes us <unk> for <unk> social relationships and to worry more about the <unk> .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we go to democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , thinking about identity , and thinking more about relationships .
so , when we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find a different way of finding a different kind of crazy thing to wear and photograph in last time and blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also on my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are used for a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; and it makes it very unique to my personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers say , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve done for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
i brought back seven some <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i made sure that i wanted to have anything i might want to wear when i only came to palm springs .
and because you haven &apos;t heard about me as the woman who &apos;s running here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i really want to show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i think or not have learned from these <unk> , not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole <unk> , including the coat , took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost <unk> impossible to be bad when you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time my life with trying to be myself , and adapt to myself at the same time .
be just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i saw as if i &apos;m <unk> , or i remember her <unk> .
i like to smile and i like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , then it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not looking good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for you .
if you believe that you are inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : developing a own unique , personal style , a great way to tell the world something about one without saying a word .
it &apos;s been proven to me over and over again , if in this week , people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give it all again .
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
i don &apos;t have to <unk> these things , because the same way around the corner is still going to give you another crazy , <unk> , <unk> <unk> that &apos;s just waiting for me , if i have a little love in the heart and looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
this is what we call our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
and a few time ago , it was like if you wanted to win a formula for a race , then they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
this is what they would call , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> system .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start coming up in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been equipped with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be with computers in free .
and as a computer in free , you start to respond to other ways of responding and driven .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they are 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this perceive and driving in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that <unk> <unk> for moma later in the year , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start talking back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom there will be out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have out of people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of <unk> ...
now , today , our environment begins to get the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of seeing our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with sense .
now the first project i want to introduce you is in truth one of our labs .
it was created by four and a half years ago in italy .
the summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was as italy won the <unk> .
some of you will remember it was in italy against france and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy won &apos;t win .
now , look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the <unk> in the middle , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , make phone calls and move .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
<unk> , people do a short call , go to the toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal <unk> .
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big <unk> .
the next day , all the center went to the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all the down .
you see the picture of the space of <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the <unk> at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
so quickly , another example of sense : this is not about people , but about things we use and consume .
well , today we know all about how our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips from which a mac computer is made of how they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where the things go .
so in this project , we &apos;ve actually designed some little markers to track the waste while he &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have helped us , something more than a year ago in seattle to mark the things that they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would throw away from .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , put up on the trash and start tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that happens a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away , it doesn &apos;t just disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw out there every day .
and if we would show that to people , we can move behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and the <unk> have a beautiful tradition of using public places as part of architecture as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were <unk> on with a <unk> , they put these tubes out , and valves , <unk> , work that open and close .
they make it like a <unk> with <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall down , you can write on it , you can put patterns , images , text .
and you can get closer to him , and it &apos;s going to open up to make them <unk> , as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it really liked him .
and we got the mission to design a building at the entrance to the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it &apos;s going to open up and let them go .
the roof was covered in water as well .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to reduce the <unk> , you can even go down the roof .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just like architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens in the inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors was stopped .
but in fact , it was a more bigger fun in this night .
all children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that was open to open it , but a building that had still <unk> and holes in water , you had to jump right now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the nice thing to create things that are used and interacting with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that the <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter flying through the air , and every one of you with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , that moves with others , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or <unk> , but in three dimensions , which changes what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different species .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then , the whole thing could be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can go to , and you can move through them that can look at them from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to form a <unk> <unk> .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so just as we saw before .
imagine that every single person is controlled .
it could have a impulse to a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or so on .
i want to show you something of the first one here .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in <unk> -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as a impulse to the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dance .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> at the same time .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , when we all have <unk> , they can play with it and gravity color and play <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a kind of impulse to the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we engage people again to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it <unk> , <unk> like you move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation to a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing about what was happening last years , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has <unk> everything , knowledge , and makes it accessible by the internet .
now , for the first time , we can do this for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can change from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of networks to the physical world .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can ask us the following challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they &apos;re doing things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way that a real cloud of particles is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them at the bottom , share the most important moments for <unk> 2012 , and the other , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both of the physical cloud in the sky and something on the top you can go on , like london new <unk> .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i had awe .
my heart <unk> , i was <unk> , while i was trying to make what was before me .
the <unk> around me almost almost 60 feet out of the water , and i was just able to wonder that this was a organism on another organism , year after year .
<unk> are born as a <unk> of a glacier , or by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get it more , and put it in a <unk> passion passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that you &apos;re easy to be isolated , separate and alone , just like we often see people .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg <unk> , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
in the iceberg , he <unk> <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to look at my footage of this <unk> as if i do portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of time , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of their <unk> along the life cycle .
one part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m going to do is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i &apos;ve done in <unk> in greenland .
very rare , you can actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he &apos;s beginning to roll , and the boat is moving on the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
he <unk> about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
so i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti inevitably is a complex part of what we admire and pay for the art world .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to go back to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;ve heard about higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate it now ? &quot;
did somebody see the movie &quot; <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers run along .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need , just a check , and instead i put a check from which i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was supposed to <unk> it .
because it &apos;s a <unk> that someone who is still wearing all that is not able to communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then draw with a <unk> that can only get the negative surface .
so they pull around and make <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are shown up there are a life cycle .
it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , after the <unk> , and the last thing , people actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we got the doors to <unk> , and in fact , for <unk> , we get a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i &apos;ve moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that , and that we were <unk> , and all the images on the walls were <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , a little bit of <unk> , and a few things from <unk> and <unk> .
we took a <unk> , and they <unk> , and we put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code for free , the software can download for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital too .
every paralyzed , in fact , can communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> in front of the great revelation .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony drew for the first time again after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we tend to <unk> his bed so that he can see out of it .
we put a <unk> on a wall of the hospital in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
we also had to put it in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he sent us an email to the following content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i did something about it .
i feel like i was <unk> under water , and finally , somebody went down to the bottom and <unk> my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
and that keeps us at the shelf , and it &apos;s going to continue to develop us .
and we have to improve much more about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s going to be the same .
and someone who has such a <unk> potential is making so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few prices .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the prices were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then in december , that was honored to us as one of the 50 best inventions , which was really great .
the <unk> of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it will give this april , <unk> <unk> in the inner city of los angeles a exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be so pretty much the toughest representative of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , when you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible to do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , that <unk> -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had something to do with <unk> , but i just captured something and surrounded me with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs together .
and this question should all be asked by you , and every single day , where you see something that has to be done , if not now , when then ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i probably am american most <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come to a scientist like this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , a epiphany for usually is something you find because you left it somewhere .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has made it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the <unk> green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me to use the toilet in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what they did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it suggested me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and at the time in the 1980s , i found it important to take a work on <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call at the middle of the night with a call from this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned about each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to go away . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew we did .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults to know me , they turned into a box full of <unk> and got put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation that i talked about was showed .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs the same way -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while they &apos;re up on 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a power engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds scared .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them the same time , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had <unk> the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set out the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he &apos;s turning the engines off .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more with the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was a horror that life was at the end .
so i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
while i was thinking about that later , i realized a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to move more and more in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington bridge , pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i <unk> better to become better in everything i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego space .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time that i &apos;m wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t get a lot more with my wife , two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right ; i &apos;ve got to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and it was <unk> during the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; <unk> .
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know from a <unk> .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling of dying , it &apos;s not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare our lives for a long time .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really <unk> in an idea , which is that i just wish me to do one thing .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
about a month after that , i went to visit a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ...
not yet .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
i was clear at the time , by connecting the dots together , that in life , it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than everything , everything else , is my only goal in life , to be a good father .
i became a miracle of <unk> that day , not dying of that day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future and come back and live differently .
my call at all that flies today is : imagine what happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it ; how would you change ?
what would they do to <unk> them because they think they would be there forever ?
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here are <unk> <unk> .
so if we &apos;re going to get the systems out of the systems that control <unk> and valves , then we can actually make a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we make it that a effective <unk> of a laptop on a laptop is used by a <unk> to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are <unk> into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> , <unk> -- mission done .
that &apos;s a simple thing , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started <unk> our research at six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense of meaning and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , a very complicated thing , which is the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed a little bit <unk> with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
that <unk> our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> was like a <unk> who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , this was a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , if a particular configuration has been discovered , even if the special program that is going to infect it is trying to get on this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , a <unk> american power station or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> the <unk> code and found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were designed very professional , of people who had obviously had all the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
probably they even knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we talk here -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so what we were looking for first was <unk> <unk> because we know what they do .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this to the real world with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or <unk> .
in order to make these theories , we think that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act on a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because there are most infections in there .
now , in this area there are not several thousand goals .
basically , it goes out to the <unk> <unk> and on the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; put me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> with the <unk> .
there &apos;s a moving part of this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to break down the <unk> , and then finally , it &apos;s going to blow up the centrifuge .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack actually was to let it start and make it incredibly complicated -- obviously in trying to make <unk> <unk> , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get it quickly behind .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of looking at us very , very closely and <unk> .
so for example , the number of <unk> <unk> is very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started <unk> scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s called the <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what would we find in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for this that we studied here .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a <unk> , and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital <unk> is actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> is taking over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and you slow it down , and the big <unk> is coming up with six <unk> in interaction and <unk> valves .
so , in large and all , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals of <unk> could be met .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- has really <unk> me out of the tongue .
down there is the gray box , and up there you see the <unk> box .
now , what this thing is doing is that it <unk> the <unk> values of sensors -- so for example from <unk> and <unk> -- and there &apos;s a <unk> code that &apos;s still in the attack , on the wrong <unk> data .
and in fact , this false <unk> data is taken from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> where the <unk> is fed with the <unk> with before <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here is obviously not just <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more dangerous .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> there where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so for example , in a power plant , for example , if the big <unk> is going too fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if they are at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , even the <unk> will notice it .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything specifically to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work very well -- in a power power or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predator -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we saw in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread technology .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
this is the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals for these attacks are not in the middle east .
they are in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we have to make the consequences , and we &apos;re starting to prepare for ourselves better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it had been very much about it that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> behind .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
and my opinion is that the <unk> is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a <unk> . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years taking me in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time being dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with eating nothing as this to eat here -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i had an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk of 2011 .
but in fact , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> <unk> by the way .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody could buy the <unk> .
so if you asked me this year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with faith .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i went to some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be able to get me to go to something so hard and so dangerous like this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a movie about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is funded by the whole film by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything , from the top up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , completely with brands -- from the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to infinity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in infinity , for always ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to emphasis .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x <unk> , but we &apos;re certainly going to imagine that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever driven from , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing out that brands are a part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the movie is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love to be happy when <unk> would help to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use <unk> , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how this will develop ?
how much money is it needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth making some really familiar brands .
who knows , if the film comes out , we may look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is extremely likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the film or a difficult thing to me ?
<unk> : both .
so , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people who you have to do with it ...
there are some places we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out it meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just so disappeared , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , to present your product as many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media media -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting <unk> that the mass brings up this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
that would not be a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is like is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency in the <unk> , this -- this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , immediately understood ; <unk> of <unk> and access to information , especially in terms of <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes out , it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scared -- like this strange bear , the still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky otherwise ?
a whole dish cool <unk> .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
look when i was a child and my father caught me in lying -- and there he is sitting , and he looks at this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of each story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is getting understood is a broad problem .
i have friends who do big , giant <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , say that the reason their films are so successful is the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , are saying , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see <unk> in the movie ?
whenever i make me on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i put somebody on , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you far more nervous ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should get a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you will have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well as women -- <unk> , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a brand a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so things like to do -- you know , remember <unk> people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe to you ?
<unk> is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the <unk> .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive power , unlike &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like to like beautiful clothes .
<unk> <unk> is true of <unk> , except for the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of <unk> and such a stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic rift valley .
man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : part <unk> , part <unk> , part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> all over the country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man five : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> helped discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for you , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live his life , the work and so on .
all these things came and start from a place , and to me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the relationship with the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be like that .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about why &quot; why &quot; -- what does it make us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , which are not them .
what else do you have to go through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be scared . what kind of <unk> are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you for your patience .
yeah . well , good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to it .
there were a lot of crazy things coming out there .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> had two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
they &apos;re very good at <unk> .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on strength instead of both .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii , <unk> of little <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is their brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would it be ?
do you have a <unk> ? are you something that brings blood into <unk> ?
or are you more like a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little <unk> , <unk> , conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh as the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are you more like a <unk> ?
are you <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , holy , <unk> and ways like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and <unk> , and they said , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this movie , that you use <unk> today to make the <unk> of the brain , both for advertising and movies .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school school , in which companies have their way to the way in <unk> schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects from which i got most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , these are where i &apos;m going to interact with things right .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people make thinking that our world view is challenges .
and how was it for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
now , since the movie was at the <unk> film festival , we can look at that .
according to <unk> , the first thing in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million <unk> from this film .
this is actually just a period of two / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the movie has not been <unk> .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
it &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has got a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , at almost every <unk> that we talked to , that would recommend their customers , the fingers of it .
something that i believe is , in fact , that if you take your opportunity to take the risks , the risks are that in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get closer to failure .
i think that if you train his employees to avoid risks , you prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that you may <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . call the risk welcome .
there &apos;s a big <unk> full of <unk> , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we make a little bit of honesty a lot .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you call transparency , &quot; was shown by my good friends of <unk> , the dollars of <unk> for ebay for ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
<unk> <unk> : welcome transparency .
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what happened to the dollars of <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in height of dollars to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i <unk> to make something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is also today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and the access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t <unk> me -- but i had too many museums and this artwork didn &apos;t have access to it .
when i went and visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried this desire to make art accessible -- to lead with technology together .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with a demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van <unk> .
i even come to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of kind of kind of new york .
you come to two because of pure -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- <unk> , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you &apos;re <unk> .
they want to be <unk> in the museum ?
open the map , and jump it with a click .
in there they are , they want to be at the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
look for them .
thank you , but the best one comes .
so i &apos;m now before one of my <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all <unk> .
these of you who are really interested in art can click -- but i &apos;m going to click that away now .
this is one of the images that we gave up with what &apos;s called the <unk> .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you see a little fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is <unk> .
but then they really want to go deep into it .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed that there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly realized that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , spoke with a couple of familiar with the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s about a game called <unk> , where a duck &apos;s going to be beaten up with a stick with a stick .
it seemed very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close and go close , you can go to the <unk> .
just to give you the picture , i &apos;m <unk> to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see van <unk> by this mistake , because ?
you <unk> in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in to one of my favorite models of this picture , until i really am in the <unk> .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but there &apos;s no time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of you , everybody -- the same if you have rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- don &apos;t play a role .
you can go on and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
just just , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put everything with <unk> , send your friends , and so a conversation starts about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , to me , the main thing that all of the wonderful things here are not about google .
they don &apos;t think about the museums , not even at the museums .
that &apos;s not what i should say .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to represent the digital medium of art and represent them quite online .
and this is the biggest question i &apos;ve been asking recently , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add to the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two <unk> .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we might be able to represent your brain .
for example , this would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see as one of the people , together with most other experimental <unk> , which need a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look at how it react . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuition that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing is just going to be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed them .
i remember looking at a child playing on play on a <unk> .
he was still a <unk> , and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i bet that the play with the <unk> taught a very valuable lesson , because the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and they stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world as long as they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find all sorts of strange things -- like they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t do so often with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side of the side has not liked it .
because if all of these things are made of particles and all these particles are following the rules of quantum mechanics , should not just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would feel better at all about the whole thing , if we could somehow show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about right now .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to <unk> it . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here is a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a bar , and it &apos;s about the edge of it .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool of hole and get the thing .
this thing has to be the ability in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all sorts of strange things , but then other people climb , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to <unk> them , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects feel as same .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind that goes on them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal was <unk> , we had to <unk> all the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned the light off , we put it in a vacuum , and we <unk> the whole air and <unk> it to almost for now , alone in the elevator , it was a piece of metal free to behavior like it always wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really moves strange .
instead of course , it &apos;s just quiet there , <unk> it , and the way it was <unk> was about like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could be able to <unk> it for the same time and not <unk> -- something that &apos;s just allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not <unk> ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from atoms in which the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time the same atoms move down and down .
just too accurate , <unk> , you agree with it .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is at the same time that the entire piece of metal in two different places is .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that &apos;s worth it for all this year in the clean room , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal in two different places can be , why not also .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with that your body is <unk> in space ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it to <unk> light and <unk> the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually are just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal , if families think about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they have given them the opportunity to choose between at least a hand full of different cities , who are all in competition for new residents .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city that &apos;s available to be welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs to build them .
so , we could just get the world very simple with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you never thought about new cities .
but just trade the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in apartments have done this ; the other half don &apos;t .
you could try to extend the capacity of the already existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to do to get out of that , in these apartments and their environment , they have laws to avoid <unk> and <unk> from <unk> .
so it turns out to be very hard to stop all of these <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block of technology , given the laws there would support a building such a building and not <unk> it .
so i proposed that governments can create new surfaces that offer enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of an reform in <unk> .
in 2009 , <unk> suffered under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a shift , whose program is both innovations , and <unk> promised .
he asked <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , test and research by consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city to essentially reduce elements .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t <unk> existing <unk> .
we &apos;re paying attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that were <unk> us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him <unk> .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present that to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in december .
i &apos;ve tried to figure out how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think that a surface in some cases per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> , who meant that we need to realize this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country up .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and even once the fourth and fifth january , a talk .
so i gave another one to the facts of <unk> talk , which contains a graph like this , which is trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , which is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite all of you have .
the faces were very serious and interested .
the head of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s <unk> a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they voted for congress for a change in the constitution , to have a <unk> change that &apos;s in particular <unk> .
in a country that has just been a intense crisis behind it , congress has chosen for these <unk> with <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on the 17th , february , it was approved for the second time with <unk> to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and october of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> in the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the business of the <unk> .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s built in south korea , <unk> big than the city center .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the <unk> .
the other place that was very interested in urbanization is singapore .
there are already two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it basically , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that allows <unk> to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already been offered to provide his supreme court as a court for the <unk> calling of the <unk> system .
and <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring funding to one .
one thing , as you already know , has been <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many companies who like to put themselves in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who say they want to live permanent to another place .
a million people are leaving latin america every year and go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to <unk> their families to <unk> work sometimes , sometimes <unk> mothers who need to make enough money to afford food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes they &apos;re even kids trying to find their parents , which they have , in some cases , have not seen since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about building a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of thousands around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to ensure that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from <unk> have asked me to say , thank ted .
do you know how many decisions you do at a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical americans in a day is 70 .
and also , recently a study was made with ceos where they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes with which these ceo is busy and how much time they spent the choices to make decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo of the week is working with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues was , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been met within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them for an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of category in the one for an hour in category ?
how good do you think are the decisions to deal with ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very very <unk> store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and 500 different species of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had to drink <unk> .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i asked me , &quot; well , how does you never get something out ? &quot;
here &apos;s the olive gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to the leader one day , and i asked the head , &quot; is this model that people really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that came up every day , and they usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we set up a little <unk> right on the entrance of the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes of <unk> or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what case would more people stand and try <unk> ?
there were more people standing when it was 24 , about 60 percent , as if it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what people bought a glass of glass in the case .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who were standing when it was 24 , only three percent was actually buying a glass of glass .
from the people who were standing when they were six , well now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass of glass , who they had six to choices than if they had 24 to choice .
now to decide not to buy a glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our hip -- but it turns out that the <unk> can affect us in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it goes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial resources save .
now , i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were looking at decisions for almost a million americans from about 400 plans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that was possible , the <unk> plan , has influenced the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that give people anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , participation rate was lower .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered two fund had a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the <unk> went on about the <unk> <unk> now .
now it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate in <unk> , if more opportunities were on choices , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , in fact , is that the more possibilities they were available , the more that they <unk> to choose and choose to choose .
the more ways they were available , the more they put their whole money in pure <unk> .
no of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend , if you &apos;re important to your future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences in people who offer more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push it , even if it comes to their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they tend to decide for things that they &apos;re doing less happy , even if they do an objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy looking at these huge shelves full of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t actually take the compare and <unk> and then can actually choose something from the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and on different <unk> -- they can just apply them in their business .
first , small .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
as a <unk> and <unk> different head and <unk> species of 26 to 15 , they experienced an increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation <unk> her 10 to the worst of sold <unk> , they experienced that the profit is about <unk> percent -- a result of two , the rise of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , they give them 45 products .
a typical walmart of the typical walmart is 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world today , and they only offer them 1,400 products -- one kind of tomato sauce in doses .
every single harvard employees now automatically takes on a <unk> part .
those who really want to meet a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to stop it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t do their clients too . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said he would be ready to offer all people in this audience a <unk> vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read to you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read , and then i ask you to clap when you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to accept gary &apos;s supply .
are you all ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that they were looking at the objective of the first time , when the second time had more information than the second time , but i would like to guess it felt real time in the second time .
because the images made it sense for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding people , to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences have to be vivid and specific .
why are people going to average 15 to 30 percent more than if you use a <unk> or a credit card than it is in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel really money .
and it turns out that if you make it something that feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve been able to leave this meeting as much as she was always , just added a little bit of one .
the little thing that we &apos;ve been able to add is that we asked people to think just about all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they would save money .
third technology : <unk> .
we can do better with more categories than we do with more choices .
here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that in the <unk> supermarkets , on the bottom and down in the northeast area , the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines have been <unk> to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left ad is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that &apos;s in the left side of jazz , and that &apos;s <unk> on the right side , then you clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something , not the choice .
and this problem often looks at you when you look at the long lists of all this fund .
who do you want to inform ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out , in fact , we can deal with more information than we think we just need to simplify them .
we need to slow down complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who gives you the opportunity to <unk> her car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices they offer per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , <unk> -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order of making decisions .
half of the clients is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> of the low opportunities , four <unk> .
the other half of the clients are coming from the low opportunities , four <unk> , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how care they are .
if you keep using the <unk> in the decision , it means that they &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i lose them .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who go from many to the low <unk> are always going to pick up the <unk> .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choice to the many , then stay there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is changed the order of changing this information .
if i start with the simple thing , i learn how i <unk> .
even though the <unk> choose to say nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still trying to pick it up .
it also puts me in excitement about the big product that i &apos;m doing , and so i &apos;m ready to motivate me to be interested in being interested in that .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- <unk> -- are going to get the <unk> alternatives , <unk> -- make it real ; <unk> -- we can deal with more categories , less possibilities ; to prepare for complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the opportunities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you choose to choose the choice .
and the more we have a choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , why that &apos;s all important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , <unk> -- when i was young , it seemed so infinite .
but <unk> has allowed us to be all famous or all our creative activities , in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded to a minute .
again , a tiny percentage of a single percentage will ever be <unk> and will look at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he had filmed in front of his house in a high national park .
in 2010 , it had been 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like the video was popular for the first time for the first time .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you do , if you call <unk> mountain <unk> .
he had set up a lot of <unk> .
and this video had actually been sent in january , actually .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : the tweet that made the video at the end of the end .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> are asking us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> &quot; seems to be coming out of nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael <unk> nelson &apos;s nelson theater was one of the first people to do a joke about twitter .
the important thing is that a individual or group of <unk> took a point of view with a big audience and <unk> the process .
and then this community of people formed these big <unk> , and started talking about it and playing with it .
now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a <unk> for every single <unk> .
unlike the <unk> conversation of the 20th century , the participation of community is going to become our way in part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> , which has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity , which are in the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the floor that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do with it .
who could anticipate everything ?
who would have <unk> <unk> or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what <unk> did you have to write in which kind of <unk> ?
in a world where every minute , two days of video is uploaded , just really unique and unexpected <unk> like the videos i mentioned .
i &apos;m not very interested in , i wasn &apos;t very interested in when i was a friend who said to me , i should look at this great video , a guy who <unk> in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket because i didn &apos;t have a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there are disabilities that make you don &apos;t really have to drive .
because this was completely surprising and <unk> , casey <unk> was a funny idea and his argument was five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and all of this leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access , and in which the audience is <unk> .
as i said , one of the most great stars -- justin <unk> -- made his beginning on youtube .
nobody needs to give up your ideas green .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling also as a owner of our culture culture .
and these are not the features of the old media , and they don &apos;t even meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was raised by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold him in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , as he has to say that his life was a single waste of waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> his .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forget his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was absolutely trying to <unk> us , but we got through it .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> is silent on lake .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already two little girls .
for them , life had been asked to ask her a job : the escape of her family and new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that she could fail .
after a four year-old and <unk> <unk> , a boat is <unk> on the lake , <unk> , <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear were they <unk> , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little <unk> on the boat .
in a <unk> , my sister and i would have drinking her himself and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the constant <unk> of the engine , the clapping of any wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that have been a lot of times , but let me break out of the <unk> of men on our boat , or at the <unk> of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start with six hours .
no apple ever tasted so much again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in 1975 .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who build a new life together .
we let us down in <unk> , one from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell of <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> between people who had one thing in common : they started <unk> .
my mother worked on farms , then <unk> in a <unk> , six days , double layers .
they kind of managed to find their time to have english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar was <unk> and was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to give up . most of them were new things that came out of the second hand .
two <unk> for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there , and there , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting on reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came to wake them up .
it opened up a <unk> , and then a <unk> and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsor were looking for a search .
centers have been built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student who asked <unk> demands itself .
in the other one , i was involved in <unk> life , wearing the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many have got over the years of help .
and because of this help , i was chosen in my last year of <unk> as a young <unk> in the year .
and i was <unk> from a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , was now <unk> le , refugee and social activist who were invited to talk about places that they had never heard of , and in homes , their existence that they could never have imagined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old when we climbed the boat .
no one had never been a possibility .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of you did what they loved , lived on the limits of possible .
and even though i &apos;ve had my degree , i realized that i could not live with a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful to , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead so easy to collapse of the <unk> , it can mean so easy that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve been going enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world is <unk> , but not how you <unk> it .
possibilities that were not allowed would be encouraged .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and <unk> .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me that the <unk> didn &apos;t go &quot; a <unk> challenge . &quot;
we had no cents a year .
at the end of one every day , i was cooking a huge <unk> soup that we shared .
we worked too late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a few brilliant of it , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
it &apos;s just a journey there .
my gut reaction again .
three months later , i moved , and the adventure went on .
before i tell the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in which <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> that was the most important person .
life has not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
at 17 , she was <unk> the second woman of a mother , whose mother struck her .
without the support of your husband , she was worried about a <unk> , by bringing him to court , and <unk> in their own case , and a more bigger <unk> than it won .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; turned out to be a <unk> .
i &apos;d just <unk> in a hotel in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in 1975 .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she came to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk> .
we told their stories and they told her that we were still on her .
at midnight , the monk was coming , and he said he had to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk : &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t catch them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s all about women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come in our lives would come to the <unk> .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every wave , the <unk> , <unk> of the engine , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee you ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this one , and you could make it safe , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all of photography at all ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t do with his camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera , was at the age of 15 .
i combined it with my former <unk> for drawing , but it was a little different , because in the use of the camera , the process was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more about going to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts with the process when the trigger is going to be <unk> .
photos like this : a construction site along a lot of <unk> street .
but it has an unexpected change .
and it &apos;s still a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
when i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really can capture , but i always want to look at it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think about a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface line .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect <unk> objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but together in a certain way , you can create something that is still in three-dimensional look than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine with photos .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , things around us around our life .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because they just look kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow in order to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
combined , but you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , together , combined photos should have the same <unk> .
and these two images meet these two demands -- shot out of the same height , and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by connecting them <unk> .
it makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part was <unk> .
but this picture is actually completely <unk> out of photos of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place to find a place because you don &apos;t have to make a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank is coming from another place .
the <unk> is from a <unk> .
and yes , i even got the house up on the island of red , to look at it .
so to achieve a realistic result , this is what it looks like from me to planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here is every piece of a very good plan .
and if you do good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it can also be pretty realistic .
so , there are all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point here is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced in the <unk> was a <unk> .
it &apos;s not very scientific about it -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe only most of the electronic <unk> <unk> , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she has a button , a button .
and every morning i get on it .
and yes , i have a task , as you might see .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds of <unk> .
it works very simple : every time i get on the scale , it &apos;s going to send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to <unk> them from my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need to help or do that , but also with a look in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i go to my <unk> , and people are talking to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , you want to be just a little <unk> today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because it could be used against obesity or it could smoke patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and to bring them together to play any kind of game to control their health better .
next week it comes to the market .
there will be this little <unk> that you get to an iphone or so on .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send it to your doctor , to share it for others , for something more than 100 dollars .
make ways that are easy to use and start to hug them with these patients in the team .
and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the machines in the <unk> are around .
we know one another where all the gas stations are .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> be to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where to find the next <unk> <unk> in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he is when he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> are already reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
and we made a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can also get your <unk> to find the next <unk> that can save lives .
and by today , we don &apos;t just want to use this as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> , to <unk> these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation , and someone goes down , it &apos;s your own <unk> or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world help us in <unk> of these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in his place .
please help us , and try to improve health not only something , but to take a hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to force us to conservation , by making it ...
... <unk> <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it might take away until it &apos;s <unk> .
now -- we can just jump that -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video , instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> code .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is show what is possible today with technology .
so you meet al .
al &apos;s a <unk> in the city of boston .
how did he get to search for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston with the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has been a lot of <unk> in february .
and they realized that the city never <unk> this fire fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , still noticed something else , and that was that the residents were able to <unk> the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do good engineers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , it can take you away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that students wrote in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do other <unk> .
it &apos;s rapidly expanding .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> center of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
this is how he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people who <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities who plan to use this app .
and she &apos;s going to spread all the time , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it &apos;s usually not going on .
the <unk> of software takes a few years to take .
we had a team that was working on a project last year in boston , for three people and two and a half months .
it was about a way that parents can figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were later told that if it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not at all .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california justice project , which has spent two billion dollars a $ two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread from <unk> , is a kind of shot before the bug on the institution of government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that she represents a new generation that <unk> the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to do things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people around the country who are standing up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up to government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know something that we lost out of the eyes .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you that you &apos;re going on it , because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
and because the government ended up taking their power out of us -- do you know , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government than i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mostly about choosing people in office .
now after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about communities , and it &apos;s about <unk> .
this is the call for service and information .
that &apos;s where you usually come out when you &apos;re going to <unk> in your city .
so scott gets this <unk> thing .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talked about human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s digital the physical physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citizen helped another citizens , but government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could be able to connect them with government performance , if that would have been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengths our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that , government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input from the other .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics are the top of the ocean .
and what is below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that this thing that we have , and for us to pay , is to make something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to get around the machines of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave to our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to reach without an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by <unk> the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight , which we all fight , to talk who &apos;s going to talk to them ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can make your opinion , on every channel to every time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care to use their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government work .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire fire called <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have been able to <unk> these fire fires all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and receive benefits .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
i &apos;d like to show you a little bit about the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;d like to pick out of my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide here , but it &apos;s really about the general shape .
this slide shows data from us about the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
the interesting here is that this slide , like so many other , which we often find in our field , is a kind of just on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we need to use this guy scale on <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back up again .
a little deeper , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
and they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would come on the <unk> scale of very <unk> , in the form of a flat line .
but if you do something like this , this changes the <unk> circumstances .
so if the <unk> would go as quickly as the <unk> progression , then we could get <unk> into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is exponentially increased by the scale of all years .
the question i want to ask you now is when you look at this exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that all for forever and forever , it &apos;s evolving as fast as now .
there are two possibilities .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this will happen in the way here .
that &apos;s really , then that means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition here .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the other way into a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often ask myself , is how this new world is probably going to be ?
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now , here we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future still is in 2000 .
further than that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future every year has dropped a year since i was on this world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize that anything is going on .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that at the moment , there &apos;s just no sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now , i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about some other things that really doesn &apos;t have anything with technology or computers .
because i believe in order to understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the <unk> of life of earth .
i think the big picture is making sense when you divide it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with a lot of chemicals in it .
so if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture of what they &apos;re doing .
some of these oil spills have a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
and all that was started to have <unk> .
these little oil spills were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but these oil spills were not about alive in today &apos;s senses , because every single one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared it , the chemicals in it have been distributed to different amounts of chemicals .
so every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which had one for the growth of <unk> composition , had faster than others and integrated more chemicals from the outside and shared it faster .
so these <unk> are going to survive longer , and it <unk> in <unk> degrees .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is when these <unk> learned a trick about abstraction .
in any kind of way we don &apos;t really understand , these <unk> have learned the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe from the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , in this <unk> , evolutionary way , they found a way that allowed them to <unk> , so that this information was stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information about two billion years , where she came out , stayed the same .
in fact , the recipe for us is that our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and every living creature uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can just write , just for <unk> , even thing in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in the airports away from <unk> .
in it -- what i did , i took this code -- the code is made out of normal letters , which we use to <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it <unk> 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants to get a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everyone on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact a <unk> , i would have written them on a virus and released it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and that <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which started to communicate these cells and interact information so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
and that &apos;s why , for example , it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how they can stay from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria in dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
so this communication allowed the reasons of communities which were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they were either survived together , or they went underneath , which meant that if a community was successful , all individuals of the community were repeated more more than evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to <unk> that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which act together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not <unk> alone .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to develop , so that the level that evolution was happening was no longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> of the organism that we call organism .
the next step was now happened within these communities .
the <unk> began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t do anything else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> , which have built these <unk> .
they began to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning and understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning was happening within the period of life of a single organism instead of this evolutionary period of time .
so one organism could not learn to eat a certain fruit , because she liked bad , and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
this could be done within a single organism in the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were needed , because these information had to be learned from the individuals who died because of these fruit , because these <unk> were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the <unk> with this particular <unk> , because evolution could now happen within a individual place .
it could take place within a time of time .
what happened after this is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
once , as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically <unk> notes from me , in hope , to create a similar <unk> idea in your head , which has a certain similarities with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is we started <unk> .
we go through the same steps that have gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods that we can capture data .
for example , the invention of language was a little step into this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on , all of our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to continue to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in time of microseconds .
you also saw <unk> little <unk> where he showed a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , has some hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem just a few decades to take .
the process is feeding themselves from itself , and so , i think <unk> is the word for that -- if something has increased his <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live in living from computers and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently made of progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
and it makes it part of the way that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using in the last time , is evolution itself .
this is what we install a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please have a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now , please do all of these randomly chosen instructions , lead all the programs , and finally choose the ones that i get to the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to kind of <unk> numbers , which would be a simple example of what i &apos;ve used for that .
so find programs that can kind of kind of <unk> numbers .
of course , the chance at random <unk> is very small that they kind of kind of <unk> numbers , so there &apos;s no way that the instructions will actually do this .
but one of them may have two numbers of numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , now take the 10 percent of the sequences that my <unk> have come to .
store these , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> that the numbers have in the best <unk> .
and this is with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the features of the <unk> from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came from combinations of programs which came closer to the <unk> than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
maybe a few mutations .
and try this all over again with another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can turn numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than every program i &apos;ve ever been writing by hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s <unk> and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of <unk> programs that did the job .
because their lives were hanging out if they did the job right .
i used to sit in a 747 with louise <unk> , and he <unk> a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made out of <unk> <unk> who work together to make their flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t you do that <unk> ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave on computers for a process which is very different from classical engineering technology .
it allows us to make things with a lot higher complexity than it would allow the normal ways to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t even understand the possibilities of it .
so , <unk> <unk> the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we are able to do these processes even faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it &apos;s going faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies from today are feeding themselves .
we raise .
we were at a point , the analog is at the time , when <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make out what the hell we &apos;re going to do here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after we get something else .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of creation of what &apos;s always coming next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here now before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about something changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in the middle of the indians at the time , we went into a car and the <unk> over the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> thirst was <unk> , he took a bow , took out in the ground and water came out .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
and that made me really sad .
i got a lot of fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without <unk> to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my idea .
and i came up with this as i thought we &apos;d get our send clocks and cameras out of it .
they thought of being inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to allow magic instead of killing magic .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that readers can connect to the whole world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it takes images and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
storytelling has always needed more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
and the child in me is really excited about this opportunity .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and the dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found very exciting .
this is how you have to <unk> the ipad and <unk> the fireflies .
and it <unk> the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and therefore every book and every world is going to be a little <unk> that i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always had maps , but these cards were static .
this map grows and <unk> and serves for a <unk> in the rest of the book .
it also shows in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
also , for me , it &apos;s important to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that <unk> with new issues , like <unk> .
in the theme of <unk> , a big problem about the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their <unk> , on their computers , without out of course .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search for a search , and you have to go out and collect with the camera of the <unk> images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do more .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to get out to make a photograph of a flower and tag on a flower .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities of magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan a interaction with which you use the video of the <unk> , and through <unk> reality , a animation of <unk> looks like a plant in front of the house .
at a point , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , read it and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology is getting closer and in the magic and technology can be done .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there &apos;s a lot of despair .
now to be here at ted , to see and hear how painful that is , i gave me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i realized , ted has an identity .
you can tell things about the world &apos;s impact .
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and power that else doesn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i haven &apos;t learned that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in each <unk> .
she was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a slave .
she was born by <unk> , and the experience of slavery was shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also <unk> .
when i met her as a young boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
and she struck me that i couldn &apos;t breathe , and then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i saw her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and when i said no to me , they <unk> me again . when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she made me quiet .
she was something that made you want to be close to her .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> , and <unk> me .
first of all , i thought that this would be a game .
i saw them and smiling , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came up to me , and she took me on the hand , and she said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i told you that you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , i &apos;m telling you that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is a year older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with her sister and me and went to the forest with us .
we &apos;re just <unk> around there as well .
then he took a drink of beer and gave my sister one , and she took me , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . don &apos;t do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now we do that , but you can do anything we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do it . do it only . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , you know what . &quot;
and he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still crazy about the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed by the ground .
i &apos;m going to admit you something .
i should probably not do that .
this will be <unk> in public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i never had to drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t really believe in .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re a little special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in <unk> , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world today .
seven million people are released on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , <unk> is changing our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population are despair and despair because of these changes .
one of three male black black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , on the <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it will also be <unk> by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that makes them much better when they are rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
fortune , not <unk> , affects the result .
but yet we seem to be happy to be happy .
there &apos;s a politics of fear and anger that convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some <unk> developments there .
and my home house -- <unk> <unk> <unk> them , when she &apos;s convicted <unk> .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population have permanent their <unk> .
we <unk> , in 10 years , the percentage of the <unk> of the civic <unk> is as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that <unk> children at death in prison .
in this country , for children , there are <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : did a person deserve to die for one of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did somebody make death for death , but : did we deserve to kill it ?
i think this is fascinating .
the death penalty of america is defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been able to have for innocent employees who were released and released from death row .
an amazing <unk> . one from nine innocent .
i think this is fascinating .
we would never let someone fly with an airplane when for nine planes , the <unk> , a crash .
but somehow we make it <unk> from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill it .
and it &apos;s exciting because i <unk> my students <unk> history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their life .
they say , &quot; no -- no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> <unk> and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what matters of our actions in historical context .
we &apos;re constantly coming together .
we &apos;re always creating new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not going to overcome , without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i gave some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give them more in germany . &quot;
it was very silent , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever ever said to us again for the systematic kill of people .
it would be <unk> of us , aware and <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where german state had <unk> people , especially if there were a lot of jews under it .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , there is this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i mean , it seems important to unite both of them .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to make in a complex world .
for me , the time means to create design , thinking and talk about the poor , the <unk> that never will be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all have to believe in the end of things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . that &apos;s how rational we are , so we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe is driving us , not just to be open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted all sorts of things , but what we needed most was a hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental guidance is the core of what i believe is that the <unk> need to be engaged in this .
there &apos;s no distinction around technology and design that allows us to be very human , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more about us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the big privilege , pink parks .
so these women met , and they were just talking .
and to called , woman <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very good . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always inspiring to be so inspiring .
and one day i sat there and i heard these women , and after a couple of hours , woman park turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the initiative is for same thing .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
<unk> want to help people be convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without a <unk> <unk> for children .
we want something against the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of deaths .
we want to eradicate <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to do very , very tired . &quot;
then woman <unk> in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to <unk> ways to ask these challenges : these problems , that sorry .
because ultimately our humanity is based on our humanity &apos;s entire humanity .
i learned a very simple thing in my work .
i learned a few simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if somebody lies , he &apos;s not just a liars .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t heard him , he &apos;s not just a <unk> .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the really amazing things that make us mind .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i <unk> too much .
i &apos;m going to tired , like we all .
sometimes these ideas look ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these children who were convicted of very hard <unk> .
i go to the <unk> , and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that should be an adult in front of court .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also have a wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more right , i started working on a <unk> .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as a client .
and i started talking to this . the headline was : &quot; <unk> , my poor , black clients , like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my <unk> , i explained that <unk> is the <unk> and the police and the <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> in this country that there &apos;s only error .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had just written this crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy thing .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write it just , but sent him to court .
a few months went over , and i just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to tell you the dish and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car , and i went up the staircase for the court .
when i <unk> the staircase for the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and he <unk> me .
then he <unk> me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched me a little bit deep in me , identity , the ability every single one , something to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you ask these crazy <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started arguing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
in <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry was that we talked about skin color , about poverty , over inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors and go off .
he always looked back through the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black man came up with a very <unk> <unk> , and he sat right behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
while the pause came in , a <unk> came in , which made it <unk> , that the janitors were in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
i came to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral <unk> of the universe is far <unk> , but that it <unk> justice .
we &apos;re not completely developed as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our all survival with survival is connected to every single person .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who also see that , just saying , don &apos;t lose the goal from your eyes . don &apos;t give them on .
you have seen in this audience , this community , seen a obvious wish and heard to help them and do something .
what can we do about it ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s going to actually do a effort to business , something from the <unk> <unk> that else is flowing in politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for death of death for a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of all <unk> don &apos;t end up with a <unk> .
56 percent of all <unk> don &apos;t come in the court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this <unk> is going to suggest that the money is in more <unk> and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the <unk> in america is enormous down .
this fact is often asked in a relationship with increasing <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not changed very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> helmet against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
we have <unk> us from the <unk> of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which bring people to the <unk> for a <unk> , for a <unk> , for the theft of <unk> good , instead that you forces you to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people get victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think we can &apos;t help anyone in the world .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really &apos;ve got a string of a string .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being ted . thank you very much .
and bin laden &apos;s death brings up an increased <unk> of death .
speakers two : famine in somalia . speakers three : spray <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> 5 : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . <unk> <unk> : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . nine : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . weapons of weapons . tornado .
recession . <unk> . egypt . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- they could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media would prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are exactly the issues of attention .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second day , our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first station for all the information is part of our <unk> , the <unk> .
so the <unk> is our early detection system , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> all the information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it goes down , demand &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , which are seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always going to go worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces is so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already done this .
and as people , we &apos;re much better at <unk> problems in a very long way , but they finally get to overcome .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled that <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s population has doubled .
child mortality has reduced by a tenth .
this is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs have reduced to a <unk> .
steve pinker has shown us that we are currently living in a very peaceful time of <unk> life .
and according to charles <unk> , it has gone up from 25 percent to 80 percent in the past 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget that .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we have defined poverty .
remember that a big percentage of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , <unk> , tv , mobile , <unk> and cars .
the richest <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of earth , would never have been able to dream like that .
the basis of a lot of them create technologies , and these grow <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to information technology is going on on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and it doubled all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how <unk> it is -- in good times like in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , it &apos;s growing up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everybody .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> <unk> watson at risk ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking at the newspapers , looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s <unk> human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the <unk> of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence would be available to every owner of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university , called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies to , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services , which are positive in a decade positive , the life of billions of people can affect .
think about that , that a group of students can influence the life of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , we can see in dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating <unk> abundance .
<unk> is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> itself got <unk> .
but the king of <unk> got <unk> .
aluminum was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome is made by the <unk> of aluminum .
although <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> , it doesn &apos;t come out as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> was developed and was so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
so let &apos;s put this analogy to the future .
we think about <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet which is filled with <unk> more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not <unk> , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india has to reduce to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees in compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was 50 percent last year .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade , there &apos;s six cents a half a thousand cents per <unk> , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we will also have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember that as carl <unk> , in 1990 , when it was saturn , it turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet which is 70 percent covered with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent water , two percent are <unk> , and we fight for 170 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water per day -- whether water , <unk> water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just <unk> a big <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything is going good , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola will apply this technology global in <unk> countries across the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , my god , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones in the developing world until the end of 2010 .
remember that a <unk> in the middle of kenya , in the middle of kenya , has a better <unk> than president reagan before 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge , and information as president clinton ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , as no one ever could have predict .
and it gets better , the things that you have and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries full of books and music , technology for medical diagnostics -- are literally <unk> and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best thing is perhaps what &apos;s expected of us in the area of health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the <unk> , called the &quot; $ 10 million <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we demand teams around the world , to connect all of these technologies into a cell phone so that you can talk to the device because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the employees of health care .
if this device was sequenced a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls out the heart disease and prevent a pandemic before their outbreak .
but now the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the largest <unk> against a population population is a better education and diet in the whole world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we get <unk> from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before are going to join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of <unk> gridlock , i see one of the biggest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier with the use of the <unk> , and they become better trained by the <unk> , and by doing that they &apos;re going to have the ability to use 3d printers and <unk> computing and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion grow , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> get us ?
how about a sentence in new , never before <unk> voices .
how about that , the oppressed , where they are always , to give a voice to make attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people get together ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excited me .
there &apos;s a program that some may already know .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s called <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
now this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern pattern is better at the proteins of the proteins , as the best supercomputer .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us in the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges and to do what is necessary .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long enough time when i can allow me to give up a piece of my own wrong <unk> to make this happen .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> , and we move to the world world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turns out about statistics , and to use these to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to bring me to a statistic of what i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , when a bat gets 300 .
that means that the player is sure three of 10 beats is beating .
it &apos;s called the ball in the <unk> , he comes up , he &apos;s not caught , and who tried to throw the ball up to the first base , it didn &apos;t go in time and the <unk> was in security .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
good , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is someone who &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> baseball player who met during a <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world &apos;s medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> to a <unk> , which is a <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area , and you have a loved person with <unk> <unk> , and her <unk> <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> that is <unk> at 200 of 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and they beat a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all of medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor should be .
but what we &apos;re doing is that we are every one of them , including me , to be perfect in the world with the claim .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s going to do the details of how this is going to be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> student <unk> .
in high school , a <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn a <unk> for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters in the sisters of the toronto general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> every <unk> , every branch of a artery that <unk> from the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to <unk> as possible that i was immune to making mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met woman printer .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto as a woman printer brought me into the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point , i was <unk> the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for the <unk> .
and to give feedback to my <unk> .
i studied woman printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i <unk> her , they made <unk> sound .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered from <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart failed , instead of <unk> the entire blood , <unk> a part of the blood vessels in the lung , and <unk> this gradually , so the <unk> came up .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i asked her and made me the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of hearts .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and about a period of time from a half and a half hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and that &apos;s where i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take out of them and did what i should have been , which would have been a call at my <unk> , to <unk> it with him , so that he had a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to get extra information into her .
maybe i did it for good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to have so successful and so able to take his responsibility that i was like that , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them home , i put a quiet voice in me , trying to say to me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was very missing to me that i asked the nurse to take care of the woman printer , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go good . &quot;
i remember it as it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an <unk> and <unk> , and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , the night i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , <unk> the hospital and went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went home through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse said , not the sister who had seen the woman printer , but another three words to me , and these three words fear most of the <unk> i know .
other medical doctors fear this as well , but the <unk> is very special because we see the patients only as <unk> .
so the three words say , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients you <unk> at home ? &quot;
asked the nurse <unk> .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about an hour after she got home at home , after i sent her home , she <unk> , and the family called <unk> , and they brought them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they didn &apos;t breathe , and she was blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved all of the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them up to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was shocked by the inner <unk> .
and i went through this <unk> because she came to the intensive care system , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , it was clear that she would never go back again .
she didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
their family got together .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they created the <unk> .
on the <unk> day , they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you know , you never forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
if you do <unk> and you never do the mistake again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> kind of thing i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that not what you did , it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the reason of my <unk> , he was very happy .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> the <unk> and made sure i wasn &apos;t going to be <unk> .
but i asked me about these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why did i <unk> them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly but sure , it put it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up , and i might say i could feel better again .
and i felt that if i doubled my effort to the perfection , and never again <unk> a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not a infection of the <unk> , but the upper <unk> and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and <unk> , felt <unk> and went to work on work until it came again and again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve lost two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot about it , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no <unk> in their treatment too .
i thought he had a <unk> .
i <unk> the kidneys of the kidney , and when that was no <unk> , my colleague , at the <unk> of the patient , found a <unk> in the lower right sector , called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues for him as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he realized a <unk> in the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it went good .
both cases <unk> on me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues argue , but is complete nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i tell the quiet voice that tells me what really didn &apos;t happen , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same things ?
if i was going to a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who talked about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yes , they go to a cocktail party , and there you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , a <unk> in my hospital would have lost someone the wrong leg , and then you believe me , i &apos;d have trouble looking at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who <unk> , and the shake , who are with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies to attack a human .
and there is the idea that if we make those who are <unk> out of medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems with this .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in a system that happens every day in one day , where one of 10 <unk> is either wrong or wrong , in which <unk> is always going to be more and more and more and more and more <unk> or dead .
in this state , about <unk> <unk> in this state die of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute for medicine was growing the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong <unk> because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in the medical school , all two to three years are doubled , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give it a easily <unk> breath , and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things like that .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of this is inevitable .
so if you take the system like this , how i was taught it , and <unk> all the <unk> <unk> , then no one &apos;s left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and then you extend your <unk> , you &apos;ve found out of your head , then you look down , and you eat hard , and you start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m doing . &quot;
what they need is a environment that you can do in the position of that .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new defined doctor is a human , knows about his humanity , accepted , not proud to make mistakes , but put everything out of them so that it can be passed on .
it shares their experiences with others .
they support if others talk about their mistakes .
and she shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , supportive way all of that benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that is so much , people also make mistakes from time to time .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn from it to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories before the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
they like to think that he <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he collected fish .
he described one of them as very common .
it was a <unk> .
in the &apos; 80s , it was <unk> in great style .
now he &apos;s in the red list of endangered species .
this story has been heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , and it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> are still describing them as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is a different concept that <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i studied a <unk> in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really get out of there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the <unk> of <unk> and from a couple of <unk> <unk> .
there were <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were living good , and they were made good at ghana above average .
when i got down 27 years later , the fish was reduced to half of his size .
<unk> measure them five inches .
they were genetically <unk> .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also lucky enough to be there .
so it &apos;s not changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe has a lot of <unk> .
<unk> meant countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing , this pretty ugly ship is called <unk> 4 .
and i went on it , and we did a <unk> in the southern <unk> ocean and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were <unk> , other animals who are connected to the reason .
the largest part of fish , the little dots there on the <unk> , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came up , and then it was <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you get a survey , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . in this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> is <unk> every time from fishermen when they &apos;re driving in areas where they never had been <unk> .
but it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> on the new level , and we don &apos;t call us memories of what was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green your country , the <unk> .
the time it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are very natural .
every generation looks at the images that they make at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and will get all of it .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
now that &apos;s largely our goal now .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like they were .
now you could think that the problem was in people who certainly lived in <unk> societies , killed animals , and they had only been aware of what they had done for a few generations .
because obviously an animal that was very often gave it a lot was rare before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a common <unk> animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
at the time , we focus on the big animals and the ocean is the big fish .
they &apos;re less rare because we start them .
the time is there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was even different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence that they &apos;re using in a former form is not how they would like to argue the evidence .
so for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a <unk> saying that was seen in this area of great <unk> can &apos;t be used , or by <unk> , usually not <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because <unk> , we &apos;re basically thinking about the past .
we make the past again that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> have changed and are very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and that benefit from the insight that allows it to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of <unk> bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and the <unk> may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by that -- besides the <unk> , why were you so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little <unk> that went out in a way .
so my <unk> , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is about cameron , so he turns &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist <unk> , you had to be , if you had a typewriter , you had to <unk> this in the government .
they also had to <unk> a sheet of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason is , the government could <unk> where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , and they could find the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would be <unk> to the freedom of speech .
in our own countries we would never do something like that .
this is what happens to us today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example of what our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing <unk> .
let &apos;s just look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in <unk> .
and the incentives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
the american intelligence agency in front of two months ago the swiss <unk> <unk> <unk> here , and on this bank , <unk> million dollars were <unk> when it was frozen .
mr. <unk> itself is on the <unk> foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only become worse .
in the future , most crime are going online .
the second second thing that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they are motivated by something else -- protest about , a opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are moving over the last 12 months and have become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are doing it for money , <unk> like anonymous who afford resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases , like , from <unk> .
it shows a model of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody was hacked , and he had hacked the system too .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the <unk> of this group to ask if he could make it possible because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in the consequence of a <unk> ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate you need to take a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example .
but you can yet , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign policy .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that &apos;s happening in egypt for example ?
well , in egypt , the <unk> in april of 2011 <unk> the headquarters for egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , there was a <unk> called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , the notes were a group in germany that the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they had -- in very large framework -- able to capture any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros at the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments provide <unk> governments with <unk> that can be able to do against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago called <unk> , this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of security that &apos;s going to be like your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer to people is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we do today , in 2011 , our governments may trust , it &apos;s every right that we &apos;re going to give up for forever .
and do we trust that we trust the blind of every future government , a government that we may have been in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> from concrete with <unk> measurements that fit together .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us the able to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
basically , the <unk> had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household did .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks are produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego , it made it possible for everyone .
lego is basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at the same year after bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that would bring us from a world of static , <unk> blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much bigger , more complex cycles , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is fair for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic algorithms that have specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about this is they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong around them .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so all you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build bigger <unk> .
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you &apos;ve created a little <unk> system .
take the switch out to make a <unk> that &apos;s here , <unk> , and they &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
add these <unk> to an extra effect , and they have made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
over the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , <unk> or <unk> , it allows you to program simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow it down , or slow down , just turn on this button , and he makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we were distributed to children &apos;s <unk> and see them play .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they start to understand the electronics that you have in the day , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
as an example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responded to touch .
we also brought <unk> to <unk> .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we got <unk> to risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics was just going to be another material .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go on the website , download all the <unk> and make them themselves .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , <unk> , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is heard of us .
so , take a go and start to invent .
thank you .
