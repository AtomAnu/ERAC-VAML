and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to deal with the <unk> separation of death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we &apos;re all singing , and dance and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
all these people teach us that there are still other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about the earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only fulfill a little bit of hope .
together , the myriad cultures form in the world of <unk> and <unk> lives that live on earth , and that &apos;s what the earth is as important as the earth is as important as biological <unk> that you know as a biosphere .
the <unk> is the great legacy of mankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species of species .
and just as the biosphere was <unk> very much , it happened with the <unk> -- only with greater speed .
and the key startling is the extinction of the languages .
when everybody was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a particular culture access to the tangible world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , an idea , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , there are no longer the ears in monterey .
they don &apos;t teach the infants anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be a lonely <unk> than being rejected by silence , one of the last people who are talking to their language to have no possibility of the wisdom of the ancestors to give children to the ancestors of the ancestors to expect the hope ?
and yet this horrible fate will actually happen somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the older human beings , and takes the last <unk> of an old language with himself .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you suddenly know how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you through a journey today through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to understand what was actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i &apos;m saying , if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his own , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
take this child &apos;s child in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , the people of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not threatened between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that &apos;s dependent on people , is <unk> .
they have a curious language and a <unk> called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry somebody who talks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the <unk> past , which is curious about these big houses in which because of the <unk> six or seven languages , but you never hear someone who is learning a language .
they only listen to them and start talking about it .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> of ecuador in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> <unk> , and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw shiny photographs from the air out of the air , which we would evaluate as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen anything from the rainforest in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face , or see the character , not and <unk> that this business cards were the devil business and killing five <unk> with the spear .
but it &apos;s not just killing the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of forest that was amazing .
their enemies could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what the species of species of this was .
now , to give you a sense of the kind of extraordinary faith , i had to know something about this remarkable faith of <unk> and <unk> , not the cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a kind of a kind of a <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the big world religions are counted , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will be left , because the guess was that there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was no religious faith , and of course , there &apos;s just one of these very profound religious minds that the tragic diaspora diaspora <unk> .
but what makes it interesting as interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living ones give birth to the spirits .
the minds can be <unk> from the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance , answers to the rhythm of living <unk> to <unk> the soul of a very <unk> moment for god .
<unk> says , &quot; you know , &quot; your white phone goes into church and talking about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , are you going to take away from the spirit . how can you be damage to it ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal <unk> without burning <unk> , an amazing visualization of the ability to affect the body that this is <unk> when it comes into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people i met , the kogi from the sierra nevada nevada <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
progeny of the old <unk> civilization who <unk> the heart of the caribbean from colombia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , this people had a huge amount of <unk> <unk> , which is rising across the <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that never have been conquered by the <unk> .
until today , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education of the priesthood is very extraordinary .
and during this entire time , it will be considered culturally in the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it out of it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we &apos;re the younger brothers who are responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so , <unk> aren &apos;t <unk> , they &apos;re still going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
now , what does that mean ?
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , by which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> preparation of the repertoire of the <unk> .
and this plant contains some very strong forms of serotonin , and <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
once you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like you saw this stuff , this substance , that substance , that it contains in different ways .
so this powder is kind of <unk> to be shot from a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
but the thing with <unk> is that they can &apos;t be taken <unk> , because by one of the human gut , of course , the enzyme is <unk> by names .
they &apos;re only taken into contact with some other chemicals that <unk> mao <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are contained in the <unk> is <unk> from exactly the way that it &apos;s needed to <unk> the <unk> .
how can these people come from a <unk> of 80,000 species of <unk> plants that can find these two <unk> plants that combine when they &apos;re combined , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , has 17 variations on the forest that they all see at a very large distance in the forest that looks like a kind of way .
and then , you know , you ask them how to <unk> their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understood something about plants .
i mean , you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 variations in <unk> and you sing them into a different <unk> .
well , you don &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the idea of the problem is that even those among us , the sympathy situation of the most difficult situation of native americans , they &apos;re looking at them as a <unk> and <unk> , but they kind of reduce the past , as the real world , which is that our world is shifting .
all cultures have been involved in the dance of new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology of it .
the <unk> stopped being less on sioux than they were bow and arrow , than americans stopped when americans stopped when they stop the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ugly face of rule .
or if we go into tibet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people will be convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the human condition , is not just convicted , but in general , the destruction of the human condition is not just <unk> , but general and <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it in <unk> .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as a followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant he had been killed during the chinese invasion of <unk> .
his uncle fled with their holiness in the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- to be wealthy .
he was caught in prison for two years in prison to hide under their <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live it without it .
the sister who did this brave act of <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
so one day she went out to a <unk> <unk> , and they had to <unk> them for seven years into a heavy camp .
the suffering <unk> can be <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people &apos;s mind is something <unk> .
and at the end of the end , we really have a choice . would we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus and surplus -- did just have 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it &apos;s hardly 300 years old .
well , this shallow story tells me not that we have all answers to the challenges that we have in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these myriad <unk> after the importance of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the north end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of our regime called the <unk> of our regime , they were forced to move in settlements .
this old man refused to be the case of this .
the family who had a fear of his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold . they used to use them .
the <unk> of their sled , their sled , were originally made out of fish , made up in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid of the arctic night or the flying storm .
he <unk> out , <unk> his pants off , and he <unk> his pants off , and when the feces started too cold , he shaped it in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> the saliva on the side of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a dishes , took the dog &apos;s skeleton and <unk> a sled , <unk> a different dog , and <unk> the <unk> on the belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit of the inuit and all the native americans in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the time .
an amazing example of how a nation , one state , is looking for <unk> with their people and to reach .
and ultimately , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , realizing they &apos;re not removed at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone who &apos;s <unk> .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we ultimately try to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , so we probably have the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website get 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations are sending our <unk> up .
our magazines are read by millions of times .
thank you .
we see many , many <unk> of digital photographs here that you can seamlessly and <unk> , and <unk> , in a way , a lot of new shapes .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is like a scan scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in an area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like , is the number of pixel on your screen in every moment -- it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure of reading and the good experience a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a form of several scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content to it .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is actually causing these ideas to end these limitations to the site of the site .
we hope that this is not a <unk> and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , this is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re also going to give it to this area .
but these are all streets in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the top of nasa &apos;s <unk> .
so let &apos;s get a little bit of it now .
now , this is actually a live thing in the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects really two different technologies to each other .
one is <unk> , and the other one is a very good research on <unk> <unk> , which from noah <unk> , in a university state of steve <unk> , under the counseling of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through images and make it resolution .
but the spatial sense of images is in the fact of meaning .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what are a lot of <unk> that are going on .
we had to worry about it because of the lawyers .
so these are all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the same way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will never believe in microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for a reception here .
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is all about professional <unk> <unk> , a pretty large number of them , a pretty large number of them in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird things .
many of you are <unk> on faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster from notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
now , the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of how , visual memories look -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are connected , and it creates something that is bigger than the sum of parts .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
look at this as the sequel of stephen <unk> &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that people use with the complexity that people use , and their uses for the users are always bigger .
their own photographs will <unk> with metadata that one person has entered .
and of course , byproduct all of these are the enormously rich virtual models of each interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not only <unk> or satellite and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
. i understand it right ? their software enables that to be in a certain time , within the next years , all images that are used by someone in the world is actually used in principle ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t matter more than discover .
if they want to make them <unk> between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of <unk> information that have many of these images .
as if you do a <unk> search for images where you put sentences inside and the text of the website contains a lot of information , which is image .
but what if the image is associated with all your images ?
then the scale of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope to share with other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make a couple of connections , if you &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
the official <unk> of what &apos;s going on ?
the official <unk> of all the western societies in the world .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the common best of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the human one .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is valuable , valuable , useful assumption for human beings .
if people have freedom , each of us is for themselves to do the things that can maximize our good good and not choose for us .
to maximize freedom is chosen by choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , they have more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives as well .
so i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s going to happen to modern progress .
this is my supermarket , not big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and in this a electronics business , there &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together millions of different <unk> facilities together from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy , you could have given every phone you wanted as long as it came from ma bell .
they rented her phone . they haven &apos;t bought it .
one result was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it takes people to walk into business and ask this question .
do you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone , which is not too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very much more <unk> than buy objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says , we could do a job or we could make b .
a has got these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a <unk> and risks and b and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if they say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like them and me , that if you think about it , if you don &apos;t think about it , you don &apos;t even make sense of it .
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , they &apos;re expecting to call the doctor the next morning and ask to ask a change in the prescription .
something such as <unk> as our identity is now a question of choice , which is to show this slide .
we inherit no identity , we invent them .
and we also invent ourselves as often as we want to .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time that almost everybody had one of them , that almost everybody had one , and they were as quickly as they could , and then they got kids as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who &quot; , not when they did , and not what they did .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry ? should i have children , or do i have a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m <unk> and not getting good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asked .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl showed , with technology that allows us to work every minute of every place on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , and again , and again , whether we should work or not to work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry probably on our lap .
and even if they &apos;re all shut down , every minute in which we <unk> our child <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly be your experience of your child &apos;s experience very differently .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived in this way that we lived .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now .
and the question is , is the good or bad news about it , right ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we know all of what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about that .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of free .
with so many options that you can choose , people fall very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investment in volunteers of volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> from <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees , and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a decade <unk> the employer , took participation by two percent .
they provide 50 percent <unk> -- 10 percent fewer staff than if they were only five to give them five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide how to choose it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow will never come .
they don &apos;t give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> , who had been happy to multiply their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of choices that are happening .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
you want to really make the decision really , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or the wrong thing to do with it .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we manage the paralysis and make a decision , we end with less content with the outcome of choice as if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there &apos;s several reasons for this .
the more possibilities there are , the easier to regret at all , that &apos;s disappointing to the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a great point today by doing this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things that are dependent on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternative resources that they &apos;re <unk> , that they make less satisfied with the alternative that they voted .
here &apos;s an example , for those of you who aren &apos;t new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have been thinking about .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the idea that he missed the possibility , day over day , to have a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more ways you have to have the choices , the more attractive qualities of these choices will be tested in the <unk> .
so here &apos;s another example of that .
now this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it now , and perhaps to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is : always who they choose for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have been many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do to make less power .
third , <unk> of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , slightly more <unk> or big ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid <unk> ?
do you want jeans with a holes ?
you want to cut down far , <unk> , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on , he said .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind of thing that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour of all this damn jeans , and he &apos;ll get the store -- and i &apos;ll say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i had ever had .
i was better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it .
the reason that i felt worse , with all these options , with all these options , my expectations of what are good for a good few jeans .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations than it was in one way .
when they were in 100 ways , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected to do , and what i thought was disappointing to what i expected .
adding opportunities in the life of people &apos;s lives inevitably increases the expectations of people , as well as well .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this . because if you would , you know , they don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was better than everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was able to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for whom you can ever hope is things that are so good as you expect them .
they will never be pleasant because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- which is what they all come from -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i didn &apos;t have to do it better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> is not always such a bad thing .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the kinds of <unk> , and they &apos;re asking why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s .
they &apos;ve been able to do it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation of the generation .
and so the evidence is that it &apos;s a lot better , and it &apos;s objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you of that .
this is the official <unk> that we all hold for right now , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choices are better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that much more than some choices .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point of choices to make our good greater .
now , as an rule -- i &apos;m almost finished -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule to think about what all of these choices are in the industrialized societies , the material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that they &apos;re too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and diamonds is : steve <unk> told you yesterday how these more expensive and hard <unk> car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt the same way .
they &apos;re worried about it that we &apos;re doing worse .
if something of the people of our society allowed to make decisions so that people would have shifted to the societies in which people would have shifted , not just the life of people &apos;s lives , but we will be improved .
economists call this an <unk> application .
<unk> will be worried that it &apos;s better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> .
and finally , reading this cartoon , and a complicated person , he says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know about ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this room , you know ? &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the idea that fish know something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , you don &apos;t have freedom , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so it &apos;s all possible , reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and decrease happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
it &apos;s almost limited to perfect security -- potentially for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects already about the human genome and what that means , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting by a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask a significant question .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and understand that in different levels .
we &apos;ve tried a different approach to simplify it to the minimum components of the components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years when we sequenced the <unk> of the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , who can replicate the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we tried to do that with a even smaller genome .
we managed to give it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
so , we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome .
does it allow the chemistry to create these really large molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material , by the way .
our steps in space were exponentially .
but our ability to write genetic code has been augmented yet yet , and our final point would be on an exponential curve now .
we started with this <unk> 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years called a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors you can do .
so we had to develop a new method with which we put these little pieces and we could correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital film , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus killing the bacteria .
we made little pieces of pieces , and we made a <unk> , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and put into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made a viral particles .
the viral particles were <unk> from the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
and i was talking about the oil industry recently , and they said that they would be able to understand this model .
they laughed more than they &apos;re doing it .
so we think that this is a situation in software actually to build the hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first to 1995 the genome , the <unk> was in a mistake of 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes , if we used to use the original sequence of the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of the design for 50 letters , and that &apos;s what you have to convey with other <unk> to build smaller <unk> with that .
we &apos;ve got unique elements here .
you might have heard that we &apos;ve got to put <unk> in the world .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we just signed up with it .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so that we could just break them out with enzymes , and there are enzymes that can repair these <unk> and bring them together .
and we started to create pieces , starting with pieces of five to <unk> letters , including these each other to <unk> letters to make them self-assemble , to self-assemble .
in each step , we have produced these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
when we get to this right big -- with over 100,000 pairs of folds -- they won &apos;t just grow these lines in e. coli . it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology .
we knew about a mechanism called <unk> <unk> that uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything else has been together .
we have thousands of organisms who can do that .
these organisms can be dried up , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using this process of <unk> with the right design of pieces of pieces , we &apos;re <unk> them . yeast combined .
this is not a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see with the <unk> .
this is footage over six seconds of a time .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are via <unk> letters to <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances , it would include <unk> pages , just around these genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus that is very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re doing it in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all hearing about .
but in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve been shown that you can have a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another , and that can activate them .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to get a little further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , each time thousands of characteristics of only one second <unk> in a species .
so people think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time , a lot of biology missing a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called enzymes called <unk> , which are actually dna dynamics .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was <unk> in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , there was all characteristics of the species lost and <unk> completely in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we were reading on .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can , by the way , by changing the <unk> , things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;m suggesting that this isn &apos;t the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design system .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need to do .
we &apos;re about six billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
to ask it to my context : i was born in 1946 .
today three people on this planet have existed for every one of the year in 1946 ; it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh water and clean water , medicine , drug fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine times .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil , which is a hundred million drums a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of it .
we &apos;re in first line of the boundaries of biological reality and to those of our ideas .
we have technology today because of this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes on the day .
if you can imagine these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can change with a very small team more molecular than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can go to <unk> <unk> , production from chemicals or <unk> , and so on .
this is a recording of real <unk> that we &apos;re working on , which you actually sit with , in fact , and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got fuels of the <unk> and third generation that will be coming out of a lot of time , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way to think about biology is a huge impact on food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a source of co2 as a result , and therefore we work on cells that go out this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a way of doing this .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways of doing this .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 in methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide that could simply be brought into <unk> , which could be <unk> co2 in the fuel to make this process .
within a short time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry -- exactly , if you could not do that at ted , where else ?
but we &apos;re currently working on the same way to apply vaccines to the development of vaccines .
they &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always going to go back a year and have a dollar back when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at people moving away from people , and our goal is that we only have a chance to survive long enough to survive . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far , and for all those those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment that ever happened -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that were less than a <unk> second after the universe -- and that to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine under geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> images in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called a atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
so here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction with the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine went on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has a huge amount of <unk> in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is the entire route to the lhc , and then with a part of the lhc , with a part of the lhc to make particles of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image about 10 / 11 , we knew that the machine works , which is a huge victory .
i don &apos;t know if this was going to create the biggest <unk> , or this one , when someone came to visit the google side , and that &apos;s the front page .
it means that we had a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires lead <unk> <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can do that because if you cold it very far , you become called <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , colder than the space between the stars , they can withstand tension .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there were a <unk> .
and so they heat the wires lightly and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
so this was the result .
now , all this is even more <unk> if you think that the magnet goes over 20 tons , and move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
now , they &apos;re all back back to their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it to it , and we &apos;ll expect to collect first data in june or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , for some kind of spark of accidents , the debate is about the value of science and <unk> in such the boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our borders , the value of things like the lhc .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more of course than that .
it &apos;s my big , lifelong love , and fascination with it .
and i don &apos;t expect that that will ever change .
however , recent thing is a strange thing in my life and my career , which has brought me to rethink my relationship with this work .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as i would be treated .
seriously -- the demise of <unk> .
for example , they get worried about me and saying , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to be <unk> .
don &apos;t be afraid that you &apos;re going to <unk> your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world interested in ? never again ?
okay , so that makes really guts .
people said , <unk> , don &apos;t you have a fear of having never succeeded ?
do you feel afraid that you kill the humiliation of <unk> ?
you &apos;re not afraid that you <unk> your life for your life , and you never get to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and that &apos;s what i had to do .
and i have a lot more fear that no one would see it .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently and question , why ?
is that reasonable ?
does it make sure that people should be expected to do the work that he feels that he feels ?
and what &apos;s exactly about the creative company , and what &apos;s going on with the creative business of the human business -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist he asked if he was scared to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t have to get the call from <unk> <unk> people .
we seem to seem that kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to have this reputation of being mentally immensely unstable .
all you need to do is look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds alone from the 20th century that young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually committed <unk> , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> : shortly before his death was in his last interview , <unk> each of my books killed me a little bit further .
it &apos;s a extraordinary statement that they can do about their work .
the question i want to ask for each one here is : is this idea for them to be completely okay ?
do you think about it ? because at only one centimeter , i feel like i don &apos;t think about this idea .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she gets taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that it would be very dangerous to me -- in my situation -- very dangerous path of conjecture -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
that means -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have more 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world to write the work that comes after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to tell you , because we &apos;re all there , because we &apos;re all friends -- it &apos;s very likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought is .
these are the kinds of thoughts that can bring someone to the morning to consume nine in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to do that .
i &apos;d rather be doing this work that i love to do .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seem to think that i think i can continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> of what &apos;s going to be the response to writing .
and this quest led me to the ancient greece and the old rome of rome .
please join me , because the circle will end up with it .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that came from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of creativity <unk> demons .
from socrates known that he believed he would have a <unk> <unk> that sent him out of a distance .
the roman had the same idea called this kind of <unk> creative spirit , a <unk> genius .
this is great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist has been protected for certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work brilliant was brilliant , you don &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
when your work <unk> -- not completely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west have thought about creativity in the west .
it &apos;s the beginning of <unk> <unk> , and people started thinking that creativity came from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , people have heard these , or these artists , call a genius -- instead of that , that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
it &apos;s like to ask someone to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and distorted egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations for success .
i think this <unk> <unk> has wiped out our artists of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- it &apos;s the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to return to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative world .
maybe not .
maybe we can get rid of the <unk> <unk> for 500 years of rational <unk> <unk> .
and there are certainly people in this audience who have really <unk> scientific doubts about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> , <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you out of this journey .
but the question i want to address is , why not ?
why not think about it as well ?
because it makes the same lot of sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words : in other words , everyone here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , he can feel really <unk> , sometimes it &apos;s a <unk> .
she said it would be like a <unk> train of air .
that &apos;s where the country was going on .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the earthquake .
she knew that she could only do one thing in a moment that was -- and that was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget that there were moments -- they said there were moments in these moments .
they caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
the poem came out of the poem and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for first .
when i was listening to this , i thought that &apos;s creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work in order to work every day and sweat , i &apos;m going to stand up and sweat me and really uncomfortable me .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes i have this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had work or ideas that are from a source of me that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s that one of the things ?
and how do we get to lose it without losing our minds without keeping us in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example , as you can do , is how you can create this musician , and i asked you to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist who tried to be able to master these <unk> creative impulses and deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go on a <unk> in los angeles , and he changed everything for him .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have pen , he has no <unk> .
so he starts to come up with this old <unk> in him , like , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be tracking from this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but rather than getting in panic , he was just listening to it .
he finished all the <unk> and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky , and he said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you see that i drive car ? &quot;
now , i look like this as a song to write a song , right ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , you know , somebody else today .
go and get leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . and it was often as dark as ever .
it could be a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing that was not entirely tom .
when i heard this story , it was also a little bit of the way i was working , and it has saved me .
not just bad , but the worst of all the time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered tom in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i talked to my commentary on a blank corner .
i talked about saying , <unk> listen , you know , you and i know both if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you can see that i &apos;ve invested everything i &apos;ve invested . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show up here , and your percentage of the deal is <unk> .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then you know what the heck is .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give up to the record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . it &apos;s before , centuries ago in the deserts of <unk> people with sacred dances and music , the hours for hours were stopped -- until dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rare , something special happened . one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen this performance in your life .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancer through a kind of <unk> <unk> , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights earlier , but everything added .
and suddenly it didn &apos;t seem to be pure human rights .
it was lights from inside the inside and from the bottom , and it &apos;s lighting up by a <unk> fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so if a performer in spain has something magical , something magical , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s this : a <unk> look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer wakes himself wakes up , and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> operation with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never rise to these altitudes .
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name , call out , but what would he say , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard to do .
this is one of the most <unk> beach of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of <unk> , if they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspect of their existence came from them .
if you might only believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of life that will be passed on someone else when they &apos;re finished .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think , in the past months , while i worked on the book , while i worked on the book , that &apos;s soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , frightening , <unk> <unk> <unk> success .
what i have to say to myself , if i &apos;m wrong , is not afraid .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius , which is asked you to take a quick moment of wonder for a quick moment of miracle through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if you don &apos;t , dance spite of your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you with this .
i think that , and i think we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> <unk> for you , just for you , just for the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate the fact that the arctic <unk> the arctic , which had almost three million years of the lower 48 states , has shrunk to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t capture much enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic are <unk> the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled red .
as you see , it builds on the <unk> , this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s <unk> in the summer .
that so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood that &apos;s made out of the body .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of carbon in carbon , which if it &apos;s <unk> , from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> material in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes , lakes in alaska are methane from itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter at the university of alaska is with another group to another <unk> lake on another flat lake .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason , that enormous heat heats up , greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level of sea level goes up , it &apos;s going up to the ocean .
and these rivers take a rapidly <unk> .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers volunteered that the entire continent has now been a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> is particularly very strong in melt .
this is <unk> 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes that were glacier a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their <unk> in the world .
in the andean andes , this glacier is the <unk> area for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , most of the water will be <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the <unk> of sierra <unk> .
this is what &apos;s going on .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
these <unk> in the world are leading to a dramatic increase on fire .
and the disasters all around the world have really been <unk> in a real <unk> , and they never have increased levels before .
four so many in the last 30 years , like the <unk> of 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this historical context , you can see what it is .
over the last five years , we produce 70 million tons of co2 for co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of eastern pacific , the american continent western and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a radical decline in the sea in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two <unk> <unk> , with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more <unk> .
but we start to see a change in this way .
here are the ones that were released in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
and in the christmas day , in tennessee , there were a billion tons of <unk> out of it .
you saw it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas on christmas .
one of the commercials of <unk> <unk> around christmas was this .
<unk> of <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will become clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in wages and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you one very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has two campaigns in the life .
this is one , one part of her .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious risk for our business .
and so we put it on the top department , and we put it on a significant tour of a <unk> to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells very well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave this one .
<unk> coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is very clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right , this is the today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security , of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects together is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free , to free us from that <unk> .
<unk> america : a hundred percent clean electricity in the next 10 years
a plan to bring america back to work and help us stop and stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty <unk> that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good <unk> jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far away from that .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you , for the time of your childhood , when you were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to reach the hands and <unk> the hands , and move out , they actually learned to think about thinking and to understand problems through understanding and change .
spatial belief is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
so this question was so emotional that we decided we decided to study the answer and evolved .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move to your hand , you can perceive each other , you can take your movements and you have a screen and you have a screen .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , because they can move away from the hands of hands and access to their hands .
and the <unk> is an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are physical , and the awareness of their movements develop to be able to see each other and see the intricacies of our <unk> with them , then we can start to see new and more entertaining process .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> , and when i put it into a direction , the video will play forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going to go backwards .
and these interactive portraits take itself true .
so when i put them on side side , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you &apos;ll notice that you &apos;re also going to notice that , and you can do something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movement and <unk> .
so , a interesting episode of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , such as color as you do with liquids .
in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to cast color in the middle , where they get mixed .
if we overdo it , we can do a little bit of it .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education also like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we people give people the possibility of fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of fibonacci numbers that i &apos;m creating with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that are a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of applause on every single time <unk> letters , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to <unk> these over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , and you try to try and try and try and try and try and try a new way .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a national lab lab , and i could move it to it to try and try it and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s some people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> <unk> on the right .
it turned out that he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so they were just <unk> to him .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the <unk> of the table that this character shows .
this is where he gets the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s getting a tractor in the scene .
the orange a tractor .
good job ! yes !
by the way , by shaking the <unk> , and they put it on side side , he can interact the characters .
... his own story , <unk> .
hello !
it &apos;s a story to open and decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you , is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in <unk> as sound , like <unk> , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can <unk> these sound into the sequence that you can actually organize in any patterns .
and you <unk> them by giving a <unk> to a <unk> .
there are effects where you can change live , like hall and filter .
you hook it up with a particular tone , and then you tends to post it .
and then more expensive effects like speed and volume that you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at it .
we start where we &apos;re going to move the <unk> into two <unk> and organize these in a series , and they expand and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass to that .
now i &apos;m going to do some drums about it .
and now i combine the filter with the drums , so i can navigate the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by allowing the pace of one or another .
and now i combine the filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as they &apos;re happening .
and so i don &apos;t have to plan them on the verge , but can improvise , or cut it on the side of it .
and finally , i can take the whole sequence of <unk> by running the <unk> off .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which is better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way that we want to give you the threshold of this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media to bring information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you all about this .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m delighted to be there .
yeah , so what should be going on ?
i just need to catch a little step , and it &apos;s very busy with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying this for a couple of years ago , and that &apos;s what i started to know because i just wanted to know , and it wanted to be even more , which i learned in theoretical theory .
so , that was my primary motivation , right ?
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , like this .
and i think the biology in general now , in general , is talking , in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and much more important , will become much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like these all genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there are craig venter now in the <unk> , trying to create <unk> , so gas from algae .
and then , under then , there are things that are completely wrong in life , which most people are not aware of , for example , the <unk> that allows us to wash 40 degrees laundry , are also genetically <unk> .
and you can continue the list of the <unk> .
and so in terms of interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going to keep on the <unk> .
so what &apos;s going to be a <unk> ?
most people know that most people know this from <unk> .
<unk> computers , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
so that &apos;s kind of a bit of the <unk> that &apos;s very sad because that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing , which is actually what you actually started doing , and what it &apos;s really about .
and they started with the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and it &apos;s been growing up with software , but there &apos;s also a <unk> , but there &apos;s a whole <unk> , there &apos;s a whole <unk> that makes all kinds of <unk> things .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also program it , and you can also find it , and i found it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
now , this is actually just <unk> eight really form , which is these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but that &apos;s now members or active people around the world .
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find a <unk> of access to this sort of kind of playful device .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more as a kind of forum where where you &apos;re talking about and talking online .
they &apos;re a little bit <unk> and a little bit of a <unk> on the way , and then there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> questions that &apos;s going on .
and based on these networks , which has done all the popular ones , have been able to have a scene that i want to do briefly .
here in the image on the left , you see the <unk> , which is a <unk> , so a private school , so a private school , a non-profit school , where everybody can do it .
kids , old , all kinds of people are going to go out and look at it , and they set up a lab and look at what &apos;s going to do when they &apos;re able to do that <unk> .
here &apos;s a group at the bottom here , a group of indonesia called <unk> , which is that there &apos;s a lot of time for it .
more than those other networks , they &apos;re <unk> .
they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , <unk> , and combine it in quite a <unk> way .
and i got up in the other picture , a lecture in copenhagen in copenhagen with an exhibition with an exhibition on a subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s not quite a young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really all together is the kind of fascination , this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with that , and also in a sense , to the society and to ask , so , okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , what you want to do with you , have your interests to bring you so much ?
so , okay now , to hacking biology , you need some kind of material .
you need biological materials , and you need to need tools , and it &apos;s also a lab .
or what you usually understand under a lab , which is kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , just for <unk> , trained academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , so you can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of each <unk> has actually evolved to actually develop more technology than most <unk> , and it &apos;s really like this .
and the oh , with this premise with this premise of brian <unk> in england , an <unk> <unk> , then a <unk> <unk> , then a <unk> and , yes , <unk> , and , yeah , so <unk> , and turned out to be bacteria .
so everyone who has already been <unk> a soup is that it has been done for long .
i then tried that in my lab home to a little bit of a scale , and then just bought me so <unk> on ebay and tried a little bit <unk> analysis , trying to do a <unk> , so that <unk> <unk> , so far .
and this is <unk> , who just mentioned <unk> , this yes , such as a kind of <unk> model of molecular biology .
and yeah , so you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that there are people who are doing it at home , until too large , so bigger organizations that have been doing more <unk> in <unk> form .
and , you know , there &apos;s also about , yeah , okay , who are we , what are we going to do , what we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what are our values , our foundation , our foundation , our foundation ?
and that &apos;s where we have a <unk> of it .
and that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just been so intuitive , and what it &apos;s like to say , &quot; well , what &apos;s moving , say .
so , i think there &apos;s a very good code in my mind .
and that &apos;s what we have , then , that &apos;s not useful , but that &apos;s yes , i think , quite well , they were pretty good at people .
and we also tried to get it back into the academic world , but we &apos;re also trying to get back to the academic world .
so , i think we &apos;re going to take a step forward , in terms of the academic world , in terms of the academic world .
yeah , what projects do we actually do for projects like this ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland was that we wanted to have a so-called optical trap or optical <unk> .
you can see it down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then we <unk> the laser <unk> and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
another project that &apos;s made from from the french group there , in paris , that worked pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he did like this one , such a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so he has been busy with <unk> , his own <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet , and he built this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then , there was the visitors in the room in the room , and then in that chair , there was a helmet in charge of this .
and then their brainwaves have been measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , is there different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states that has just been doing with this <unk> is that the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , that &apos;s the most complicated , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to reproduce , <unk> , fragments of fragments , so you can make them visible .
and the machines that make something like this are pretty expensive to buy commercially , the cheapest ones are going to come up with <unk> euros .
and it &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , but it &apos;s a very cool technology to do it .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
i think , somehow , such six dollars or something .
but in every case , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> view of my mind .
a project that i started to do recently was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two centimeters or so .
you paste <unk> on <unk> , and the <unk> then then , and then i put it in the <unk> , and then i put it on <unk> , and then they put it in the light .
so the device that you see here is not working .
but this is like my prototype , which has looked quite a little bit like a branch , which is that on a branch , the thing is , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i &apos;ve taken a <unk> and put it on it .
a <unk> , if you get the full power of water , that &apos;s enough pressure , so i think , 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and so you can speed up the particles strong enough , and then they &apos;re going to go into peace .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros , or something like this , <unk> <unk> as well as the 50 .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , this is actually a moment that &apos;s actually the <unk> of the scene to increase that availability of technology and also increase the information and the <unk> that people can engage in .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively a little idea of it , and also not a chance to form it .
because if you &apos;re reading about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same as you did it once or seen it .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet more than <unk> citizens in society , you want to meet and join a conversation , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then it <unk> under the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so you &apos;re going to be <unk> as a citizens to be able to get through these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who <unk> at least <unk> website , <unk> website .
it &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people in the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there &apos;s fewer people in there when they actually exist .
so i know about some of the things that have not been available .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people , the individual .
so partly with these <unk> , so these places put together .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> did it .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , which has become <unk> all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to move around , and then we &apos;re also a similar <unk> , so that you can do it more well , so you can have more .
and i would invite everyone once to talk to it and even try to figure out what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity and <unk> energy , then you &apos;re going to get far away .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work people &apos;s disease ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moved to as a designer , but also in the <unk> <unk> , and in front of all the things in the <unk> .
it &apos;s about how to start people in interactive media , so that they can use this interactive media , and so they create a very <unk> experience .
and i think that the interactive media system , in us , is that cognitive models of <unk> , cognitive models , the paradigm that in our biological memory has been encoded in very , very long time , and that we can actually create that by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> , which you &apos;ve met in the future , but actually it &apos;s actually the way that the future is right at us , in our <unk> roots .
now , what are <unk> models of the world ?
i &apos;ve written four <unk> <unk> , and i want to explain to you a little bit about it .
so to <unk> cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve been doing in the pre-industrial way of the pre-industrial time .
for these <unk> models , we have heard that we have an principle of natural relation to virtuality .
basically , that sounds very unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to the same thing , and will prove to you by trying to prove that it has a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is , we &apos;ve been able to talk because of these <unk> models , which are very , very strictly to talk , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains itself from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition of definition , which contains the denial of the linearity , and what we naturally say is the linearity problem today .
the fourth point is that the history of us is a place for us .
so how is this now with the virtuality that &apos;s actually the most natural thing of the world .
i want to show you a little bit about that .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
now , we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it will happen , but it &apos;s going to happen in the moment .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> they live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
it <unk> the reality , and it &apos;s not a computer .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we give us trouble for example , for example , the virtual reality in our software system , we can actually do that all the time .
and that &apos;s the wealth of the virtual reality to <unk> the reality that people have needed in the pre-industrial time , because they didn &apos;t have any .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory is going on .
in this head , knowledge has been <unk> and using these virtual images , which were imagination , who was also passed away .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about it is , if i can take a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
and the interesting thing about this is that at that time , the human is at the same time , and the medium itself .
now , if you think about a piece of time .
what &apos;s media about that ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change to change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you about this one .
major tools of <unk> have been given stories .
<unk> , preacher , called <unk> , were extra <unk> to keep knowledge in stories .
and we still hang out today , very much of stories .
the author of the book <unk> , jonathan <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;re still <unk> <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means that for a child , it means to reach the most of the <unk> people who spent most of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now , we think our love for stories depends on us as a child on our parents &apos; lap .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s a lot further back , in the evolutionary cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me in the realm of interactive media , as a particularly impressive thing , we &apos;ve shown that we have extensive emphasis in our biological memory , the ability to think about it .
i brought to you an example of the north american tribe of <unk> <unk> .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island , come to the island to get food .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing with the <unk> .
you might know that , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit of interest in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they have used to use it as well as <unk> <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped by songs .
where the language of the language was <unk> by <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and those rhythm have shown the geology , the topography of a region , of course , of course , that you could <unk> these songs and sit in different ways and put it in the left and also move back to the <unk> .
but why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from the top of a b ?
anyway , in order to navigate .
what &apos;s really happening there ?
this is what happens to the <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve been going to get rid of it in the same way .
and what happens is that the age of age , and it &apos;s happened to be the book , and it &apos;s happening .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to us that we have the responsibility for our memories and that their own production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so unfortunately , , unfortunately , we have a little bit of god in the <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us being alien to us , and there &apos;s nothing to do with reality .
from <unk> to the age machine .
what &apos;s the impact on our thinking , and what about our <unk> ?
and then the most profound movement of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have more <unk> over the course of centuries and more <unk> through the influence of the <unk> .
that means instead of giving us individual individual , we &apos;re very common , very common patterns of memories that we can hang out of our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
we have a abstract language of a <unk> language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that things don &apos;t have anymore in images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to the fact that things were linear .
and we &apos;ve embraced the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions like this .
what &apos;s stayed with us is the <unk> of the world .
we &apos;ve always been arrested for <unk> , very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on here ?
we had the <unk> <unk> <unk> , we had the age machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , they bring us back to finding these possibilities back again .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain a little bit about that .
there are technical concepts like example , like <unk> reality , which is called the extended reality .
so , of course , as crazy as my talk may sound , we &apos;re moving in not existing , virtual worlds , just after the model of <unk> .
and other examples are the <unk> , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human basis .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been graduating , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two ones are the ones that are here today .
you might just stand up for a minute , so you can talk to the <unk> of the project .
and i brought this project to me as an example of how again to this <unk> , cognitive models will be addressed .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
and of course , what &apos;s extremely <unk> , of course , and it &apos;s a game game .
and if i say play game games , you know , you know , you know , you know , any people in front of people before <unk> <unk> , or that they play with some <unk> in the hand .
in any case , they &apos;re doing this .
that &apos;s a game out of it .
and this is actually thought that i discover the world outside the world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , with the real world .
and i apologize to the fact that i &apos;ve got so much <unk> .
you can explain that , then , you know , much better , there &apos;s more than a lot more to it .
and it &apos;s about the fact that i discover a city of time by watching places positive or negative .
and so i get to look at the city of the city , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city , and get a whole different , virtual map of a very physical city .
and that &apos;s what we can look at .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world is living in the walls of our cities , right ?
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if these bag were there a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate the same thing in the world .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious .
yeah , kids are inherently curious about nature or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a <unk> of the house , and i &apos;m also involved in course , of course , with the issue of curiosity , and how the curiosity changes our thinking , and why we &apos;re going to lose curiosity , and so on .
and this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with the pace of life as a designer .
if professors are curious , they often get <unk> in such the n of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half of a year .
a <unk> of the subject of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the designers starting to do with such natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because the things should be more intuitive , because things should be more intuitive , always natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s really natural for us , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
so i &apos;m busy doing it when it &apos;s natural or intuitive .
you might have to look at it again .
why does this happen at all ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , we &apos;re looking at a little bit of this , and we &apos;re moving away from the third <unk> or the <unk> .
so from modern in the <unk> .
every society is defined by a <unk> .
in the beginning , the <unk> of the language .
and what that means is , you know , you &apos;ve been able to talk to a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could be able to communicate in the same cave or in other areas , cities , and have this kind of <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , but it was a very natural , a very natural one .
if you have to learn , so not a toddler can talk from nature , but we learn it , and we &apos;re learning about it .
it then has been dozens of the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because of course , because of course , the living language started to <unk> in form of writing , which is what &apos;s called <unk> and alive , i &apos;m starting to start and <unk> it in stone and with it .
ever after how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s obviously a very different coverage of when it &apos;s alive .
but then <unk> was going to take this script as a <unk> , and it &apos;s got <unk> .
then the next generation that we actually came to live in today .
this is just by pressure and <unk> <unk> writing with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was as a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and others said , are really insane when the people start reading , then , after the people starting to read , they want to join a conversation , and that &apos;s , of course , totally <unk> .
obviously , that confused us because we see the new media , <unk> social media , facebook social media , facebook and so on .
and these two worlds are opening up on each other , new and old thinking about it .
and the exciting thing about this is , if you look at the light , this new society , these <unk> , have a lot of mechanisms , principles , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but now , no longer at the local level , but in global level , it &apos;s <unk> .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global thing .
not if i think locally green , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then the whole thing works .
that means that the local village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , very intuitive , but also total transparency .
as you know in the village at the time , who has something to do with who and when , as , as this , it &apos;s going to happen to this extension of our self through these mobile <unk> systems .
it &apos;s that we know globally , and it &apos;s getting faster and better and better .
that &apos;s how it happened earlier to the village .
in front of the background , i just got to look at what does it mean for us , which is , of course , what is natural , what do we have also <unk> , which is instinctively , what makes the difference ?
because often , people can &apos;t do it , they can &apos;t do it in order to deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , because it &apos;s not just that , and it &apos;s not just going to change it .
you know , you know , as a student , you &apos;ve been doing the issue of perception and the <unk> .
and this is , of course , where you start and look at where you start and watch and say , okay , now i just look at the inner self .
and what does it look like , right ?
so how do we work if we were there ?
and what means , of course , intuitively , intuitively , how do our channels work in perception and how does cognitive work work ?
because steve jobs once said you <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at details if i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is what &apos;s called the core .
and looking at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say alone , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word , but don &apos;t know what it means in the same way .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding in the core , when you get information to information , when you &apos;re going to get information from information and you know , i know how to do things like that , and then you can do things like this as i can do .
and of course , how does design affect the sense of perception .
so , very much natural , it &apos;s in a vessel , but i &apos;m looking right at where &apos;s salt and pepper in there .
and if i say someone else , give me salt or pepper , he will look at the right , where it &apos;s in .
and then , on the left , just intuitive to me , and then hopefully that no sugar is in there , which is the salt just accordingly .
but also our perception of itself , as it makes us feel like that .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same big , and yet our perception , depending on what we do in the context of the context .
anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should be done .
there &apos;s a little bit of my glasses to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n of the room .
a second circle is beginning to connect or associate something like this .
it &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , which is also affecting us in perception .
important for the designers , who are most likely to have the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> that near , <unk> the continuity , and so on .
so often in the third time , it &apos;s been forgotten .
but this is a essential component , if you want to make things like this , just to make things like this .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is this .
sounds very trivial , but it &apos;s very exciting , but if you &apos;re closer to it .
so we have the eyes , and now you think , you know , we look at the back of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
they &apos;re looking at it from back to the back .
because it &apos;s an assumption , you know , you see something you see , you see something you recognize , <unk> circle .
this is what we &apos;re looking at , we &apos;re just going to see ourselves before we see it back back into our <unk> , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got a lot of cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also where it comes back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not going to go and say , well , you know , even again , if you look at what you see .
and then it goes back to back , and then it will actually be seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how things are happening , and what &apos;s going to happen to <unk> these things .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described to you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who knows what &apos;s going on .
anybody see some particular thing .
a <unk> , right ?
if i saw that , that &apos;s that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , then you know .
you &apos;ll never forget more , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now , look at the <unk> .
and on , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i mean , i actually mean , you know , i don &apos;t really realize you &apos;re unaware of any of the patterns that you don &apos;t know anymore , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very short way of seeing this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is this projection of seeing , <unk> , seeing it .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go forward , i &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then then , in this , yes , gray processes , don &apos;t actually do it , but here in this <unk> mass , it &apos;s just not going to happen .
anyone know what three seconds is ?
long , yes .
this is our present thing .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i sort of look at the present in the <unk> , then i can bridge it very well in a very good way .
it &apos;s just to process it as a present thing .
then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant <unk> for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s <unk> about milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fell in love with it .
that means that if you know that , you know , you &apos;re looking at who you &apos;re looking at as long as long because i don &apos;t get any <unk> for what you can do .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the amount of wisdom that we have .
that means that this first idea is happening in a rapidly fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re going to protect ourselves in our environment , we &apos;re also able to be able to think about that .
of course , the designers don &apos;t just think about the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but of course , with the theme of the <unk> .
so , how about a human being in terms of things like this .
so there &apos;s the practical functions , so there &apos;s such a <unk> thing , and so there &apos;s such a <unk> thing .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i actually have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why are someone like a little <unk> , where not any kind of <unk> , so <unk> money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
and we &apos;re more likely to think about the <unk> , which is , of course , with us as designers .
back to my actual point of natural user interface , and the theme of which , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means always , how can i do a certain goal , or how can a user , or how can a users can do very effective , efficient and <unk> a goal .
that &apos;s what &apos;s more the norm about it .
how can i do something like that in a minute ?
can i control it directly or need me &apos; n , or i need to do it , or i need a training of it .
and less <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s been <unk> .
that i &apos;m just making it different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you also have to understand that .
it &apos;s not just intuitive for apple to do a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i just want to harness technology , if i just want to harness technology .
why ?
because in the rule of view , we &apos;re using this new kind of <unk> , which is the natural user user , for example , five times faster in average .
you have to imagine that if you do something of classical <unk> , you need five hours to take five hours with this new type of natural software .
it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re going to go to the end of four hours to go home , but their employer , or anyone , will be able to do it with the four hours accordingly .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a <unk> for us , of course , to make a sense of it .
so if we &apos;re going to go back to the area of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line that was very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing that &apos;s already called the <unk> model or mental model like software <unk> , and they &apos;ve been working , because you have a notion of something , the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so no more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor is a metaphor .
and that made it much more <unk> , but it &apos;s also a lot better , obviously , of course .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m going to do a lot more more often than designers than look at it .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that i &apos;ve always been looking at the appearance of the success , just the <unk> is a app .
and then , if i get a step back into this natural user interface , where i was with voice , with language , with speech , by <unk> , by gesture , and not more from mouse and cursor to drive things , i &apos;m still faster and left .
but again , that leads me to the point , when will things get more intuitive ?
if you become more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend here here and see what &apos;s going on , what does this mean , right ?
and that &apos;s what people are always intuitive for us to think about , if i have to think about it very little .
so he wouldn &apos;t like to think of it as well , but it &apos;s just going to be done .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we look at that , we can transmit existing <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use it as designers .
that means i can put a intuitive , intuitive human <unk> on a software and put the software to a lot of <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most important thing about the <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;ve been told .
this is what &apos;s called <unk> .
each of us uses each of us and <unk> an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
all of you do that all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s pretty intuitive , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or instinctively .
now , the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world in young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by us all the time , without that , most of us knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times from us ever to activity , so in the sleep room , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often than a day .
i can now direct this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to get this out of a <unk> .
yes , everyone has eaten cake .
je : now i &apos;m going to <unk> with the object , you know , <unk> again .
i &apos;m going to get rid of all the whole experiments now , and i can &apos;t say , let me give you all the thing about chocolate .
and once you have a interface , which is much more intuitive and very much more natural .
i want to empower you to a very certain aspect of curiosity .
and curiosity is not going to learn about that .
that &apos;s why everybody here is and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to do it now , basically , basically all these <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality of influence .
and there &apos;s a central point of it .
and that &apos;s based on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day , you give us a + increase for two gram of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have a teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have a bone in it .
we could only glide as <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
if we don &apos;t have phosphorus , we don &apos;t have phosphorus .
remarkably , it &apos;s that we &apos;re dealing with something like this , which is actually something that was actually <unk> .
because everybody talking about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
<unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;re going to have a lot of more uranium in the world that &apos;s used to be much more uranium in the environment than in all <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons have been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take on .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so for example , <unk> the environment , driving less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , less energy .
that &apos;s not the protection of that .
this is as if i would say , <unk> your child , only three times more than five times .
it &apos;s just a little bit less devastation .
if we think about that from the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire earth will be used sooner or later a cemetery .
it &apos;s about thinking about the <unk> of <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as a first thing .
the bottom is over <unk> percent of the <unk> .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and 30 kilograms of 30 miles per hectare or 30 pounds per hectare per hectare , or on the square feet .
that means we &apos;re losing on the ground about five times more than a new one .
well , of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> have been <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , they &apos;re going to grow up the diapers .
so , that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby takes about six <unk> <unk> .
we could reduce it for about 10 percent , but what does it do ?
it &apos;s balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to these diapers ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you a little bit .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted at pigs about the solid feces .
the people on the urine of the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what happened to you , right ?
traditionally , we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you tell the people that if you tell people to exist , if you say , it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then you &apos;ll be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing wrong than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you &apos;ll say , if you <unk> a human population , you &apos;ll get the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could use termites , but in the united states , nobody likes termites , in that far , although they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we &apos;re doing , and because they live only three to six months , they find it in their weight , in the energy consumption , they &apos;re in the energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree .
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be dumber than the trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
happiness isn &apos;t , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees in the <unk> .
you &apos;ve heard about it a little bit of <unk> from trees .
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than a tree .
and where you see , even with something like demeter , <unk> <unk> , it doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back into a loop .
and so we &apos;re too many of them .
it &apos;s happening .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all call that our own poo .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many of them .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to being less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s the environment , the highest isn &apos;t there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot , you would have emissions .
so , you can &apos;t solve this one .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrition back down .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
in fact , we can <unk> nutrients in the way that we &apos;re doing it in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take the waste out of it .
in china , in china , one of the <unk> is still a <unk> , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to get our nutrition back .
that means that the whole western <unk> draws itself from the city still , but the farmers never came back .
and by the way , cities had to grow more , because the farmers went into cities , and the cities had to go further away from their nutrients .
all the western rich are always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you have <unk> civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat for food , you expect to eat as long as you &apos;re looking at the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat it for food , not to <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet how to get the nutrients back .
and the great thing about that is that the <unk> <unk> in the favelas around 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , so we don &apos;t need to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
it &apos;s natural , of course , but the sites are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just manage .
that means it &apos;s going to go back to the <unk> .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built now over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities were ever <unk> .
they could just be <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then it would be destroyed for years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people &apos;s people , as much bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want , you know , in germany , in germany , it &apos;s best free from all wastewater treatment .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe they can help the <unk> , but they might help them .
because the <unk> plant could be the best of the phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s going to be true .
we used to put it in holland now in holland .
the dutch government explains , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries who control almost 70 percent of the <unk> in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> in the world .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and the oil is going to be able to replace it by other energy energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace the phosphorus .
it &apos;s not about making the existing existing thing , but it &apos;s about to make something really bad .
and it &apos;s all about asking what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand that easier because in holland is the country in flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you have your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;re <unk> , and you come with fifty <unk> .
completely inefficient .
but all of the time , yes , yes ?
or take a <unk> of it .
a woman in germany eats about six pounds of three kilograms during their life .
all right .
this is not exactly exactly scientifically , because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> it is .
but a <unk> , even at that illumination , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very , very effective , yes ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not about resource efficiency , but it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
not going to burn the <unk> for a little bit better and <unk> it and to lose the entire materials of the cycles , but first time to ask , how do you include cycles ?
imagine mozart efficiently .
yes ?
if i <unk> them to dinner and say , yeah , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> .
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not going to save it to prevent .
all the <unk> .
we tell the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have green green .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right , yes ?
in every location , where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you get <unk> .
but that &apos;s the wrong thing .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in how we think about north america .
there &apos;s every footprint there that is <unk> .
if they run , yes , every footprint fell down the ground .
because the soil will die the mosses and the wind , and the water is washing the soil away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but when i ask her , what about her wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
it &apos;s just the minimum of it .
so don &apos;t save , let &apos;s avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like people in the high bow of the car , get rid of it .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s <unk> form , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> fluid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building it everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so they &apos;re going to contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so these are two cycles of cycles .
not all of them should be <unk> .
a tv machine or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be that they have to go into biological systems .
the things that are only used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all direct ads , and not for the company for <unk> <unk> , but for the fact that you can help this company , you know , making these products successful .
because we don &apos;t make the things more free .
yes ?
so , when i &apos;m eating them to eat and say , this is free of <unk> , then you don &apos;t help it .
no , we stuck what &apos;s in it .
positive .
so , not like <unk> .
not toxic in the world .
but everything that &apos;s in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can do to <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> and go out and go into organic cycles , yes ?
all of this is <unk> .
and if we can do it , of course , of course , it &apos;s natural for us , of course , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s <unk> in the world that will be caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you help me ask , ask for people .
hey , <unk> , do you really care ?
because they have changed twice the world .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really were <unk> .
so , help me with a little bit of this .
but it &apos;s happening .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s it .
we can do things now that you can do when you &apos;re <unk> , you can do it in biological cycles .
it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going on .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> on this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , who &apos;s made to go back to the circulation .
so , in every store , you can <unk> the things .
if you come to that , yes ?
remember the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you &apos;re at the moment , the waste .
there are these <unk> <unk> everywhere , almost .
in the countries where people get to money .
right there on the <unk> , but else in the landscape , yes ?
yes ?
in fact , if you take these <unk> <unk> , they <unk> them , <unk> and take the powder to plants to plant trees .
this is the baby <unk> for the whole life , already from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can still reinvent everything .
i founded a institute of it .
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be involved .
there &apos;s extra a club to get out of where everybody can participate .
so not saving , don &apos;t kill , reduce , reduce , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music is a language .
in the description of my talk to my speech , i &apos;m writing as a <unk> , and i &apos;m a <unk> , so in english <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are the translator in <unk> music .
to translate english to english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , because if you go to poetry , it &apos;s about poetry .
it &apos;s totally alien , but it &apos;s <unk> , which we were doing musicians with our <unk> .
as a result of a <unk> , i first have the written notes .
you know , they &apos;re sure that composer in the notes did exactly everything that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly as exactly or <unk> , like a verbal verbal sense , as well as a verbal <unk> , a landscape of landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers can &apos;t smell the smell of the flowers , just to see the degree of the <unk> not to be able to hear .
this is called the interpreter of this <unk> data in another one , which is <unk> , namely , <unk> , concrete <unk> , in particular .
today , i want to share with you what i &apos;ll translate to musical musical , so <unk> , even into a verbal language .
so basically , an translation of translation itself .
so i prefer to do that all the time in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be <unk> to me in translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as well as spoken with spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be to learn just to read grades and the right place to press keys on the piano or the right place .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint with .
you just see the letters of the letters , you know , if you can do the language .
so for example , you need to have the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language of language .
so there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively , or you can also talk active to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts similar to like a <unk> .
after first , after having chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to take a <unk> of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thoughts from composers themselves .
you study the work that he created before and after after .
you ask the comparison .
the <unk> , writing it up .
how and what did he feel ?
what were the circumstances of the society , like the society and the politics ?
it &apos;s all interested in that .
you think in this time you &apos;re reading about contemporary images and reading literature .
but at the time , you &apos;ve also had an interpreter of a rich knowledge about the composers that you &apos;re playing for more times , and it &apos;s always easier to feel inside it and feeling it .
the composer is always going to be a friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is increasingly going to be more and more my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes all the other than a <unk> record of the message of the composers , but just a framework , i turn to this framework to turn it back with meaning and significance .
and i &apos;ll say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i &apos;m playing out of what these sounds might have mean .
now for me , and for the composers at the time , what they might mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase you have , you get a sense because i feel it comes from my own personal <unk> .
it has to be <unk> for me here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s still a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long , that i started to see how long it was .
as you see a happy new day , again , even though with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , to work , to work , so i &apos;d always be able to go back the same piece .
i &apos;ve become a day older coming back to seasons , and my pulse continues to slow away at night than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer to return the sound than home .
i take a breath of the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all of that influenced me , and all that influenced my experience with the composition of the composition .
it &apos;s a wonderful thing when i stand up with a <unk> on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in there , and you &apos;ll get it in response to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we don &apos;t have so much , and what you can &apos;t get out of .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to make music , and they &apos;ve experienced the audience when the audience communicates alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;ll never play a little bit more like that .
i can &apos;t play it today as in 20 years .
so i &apos;m going to have more experience than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot of life in my palette of the <unk> , and emotion and emotions have been as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have new <unk> .
have a nice physical example of it .
it was on a <unk> <unk> for my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> <unk> , <unk> professor , and a professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was still too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet him , very early , with 13 years old , and so i had to meet in my school classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses again , and i played the last one of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
this is such a <unk> part of it .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and then he <unk> and said , &quot; so what ?
that has to be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but you don &apos;t have meaningful memories .
i play the play today every few years , and it turned out to be activated for me , although not only changed no grade .
and every time it &apos;s exciting , it &apos;s exciting because i read something new .
an example of it from a very different area . monet has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , as he saw it , as they looked at it .
his personal <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece of it is comparable .
now , i &apos;ve been also older as a chopin of <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he was still living for <unk> .
and it &apos;s important to look at me again in the notes , even when i mean i could memorize it .
to keep <unk> , right with composers .
because the notes are the only link directly to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
well , i said , you know , you &apos;ve got to say about the spoken language of spoken language .
so often , the <unk> is already learning that you &apos;re only learning the notes .
you learn basically reading this , before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the sounds of the notes on the instrument .
and then , if all the fingers in time and right as it goes into the notes , then they come out , they come out of sound that sound like music .
when the accurate thing happens , the student gets rid of the <unk> .
in interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of the world .
all right , so there &apos;s a quick piece of <unk> , which is a quick piece of play .
<unk> , slow .
loud and <unk> , f and b , et .
this is what most of you know about .
but also , if you translate these data , it still remains something technical .
and yet , it &apos;s not always interpretation .
i wonder about it .
i wonder that you often forget something very <unk> .
that is that to make music on the instrument that &apos;s going to be going to be able to do their musical and feel .
that &apos;s singing the way .
a child that didn &apos;t learn the sing of the singing , because the parents don &apos;t have to do it .
this is like <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and idea of music to get it over another way , so to sound about an instrument to sound .
people who have never been singing , have never immediately felt about their own body , how it is to form a sound .
design a phrase with your own breath .
the instrument of music is the expansion of our body .
our vocal chords were singing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> <unk> on the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
now , the <unk> <unk> <unk> nowadays is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to be able to make music if it will be boring .
no longer need to be whistling or singing .
every own music will be <unk> when you &apos;re constantly <unk> from the outside of music .
so , you know , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can do , can you do not sing , a , because you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing , right ?
in both , it &apos;s not too late to figure out if you can &apos;t find it , or learn how to do these little muscles that hire the vocal chords of the vocal chords .
that &apos;s what you can train in .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
i wonder how <unk> competent was that diagnosis ?
did you have a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have no music to do it .
but what i would say is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but you might also be able to <unk> it up .
well , you can see , in all cases , nobody needs to be a <unk> candidate .
but say , you don &apos;t say , well , i don &apos;t understand the classical music system .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but sure , you can say if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s someone , it says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes to me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t give up to food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give up on classical music because they don &apos;t play a tool .
listen to consciously and say , if it tastes or not .
whether the music is going to be <unk> or sweet .
tell me what you feel .
with time , they also get <unk> , and they want to do something more spices there or taste , even fine differences .
now , why do i urge you from my audience to be active ?
because the music is a language and a language that is communicating there .
a piece of art that you never look at is not going to be the power of life .
the food that was cooked by a chef or a chef <unk> , has to be eaten , and not only looked at the same or recipes .
so you &apos;ll hear , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing to do .
when in an environment , where the adults are active music or at least active music , a child grew up , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask a <unk> to ask , what color does your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child plays after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
so that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation of it .
and what happens when you play a piece today that &apos;s originally been written in a hundred or a hundred years ago , or just three years ago ?
now , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was no piano in the time of bach as a instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had had the <unk> possibilities of today .
i can get the <unk> that had had the stream to sound on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
you also know about beethoven , he had been hearing more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which has been rejected by a orchestra from then .
that &apos;s why composers rely on us <unk> that pieces of pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> by what they only imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you &apos;re going to think about today in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what is envy ?
were they <unk> before ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend , who drives a <unk> .
so when i come back , with my little v w , and i &apos;m going to go back and see this feeling .
i won something through the head of the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to have a big car ?
that &apos;s the first year for half of his value .
and at all , you &apos;re working much less than me .
why do i have to afford to have a little car of a car ?
and then immediately , i &apos;m going to get it to a <unk> .
it &apos;s against justice .
and how i say the word justice is this uncomfortable feeling .
our organism invented a great method to make such painful feelings like envy emotion .
you can also try that with words like revenge or <unk> or something .
now , i want to tell you something about this mechanism , or something like that , or <unk> something that you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism is made out of the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard you know when people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then stones <unk> , so he <unk> them .
you know , a lie of such a lie , that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out a little bit of the time that he &apos;s in mind .
it just sounds like it and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is that they &apos;ve got to deceive themselves .
they need these lie to get a <unk> to get a <unk> upright .
they can <unk> them less easily , yes , <unk> or <unk> .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote talks that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso &apos;s wife .
this woman has complained that the portrait would not look like this .
picasso &apos;s saying , wait for it .
it &apos;s going to be more similar .
in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to know something , what artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist share them with something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when they just look in the mirror .
the artist gives you something like this a portrait of what they &apos;re really familiar with when they look at this artwork always .
then this disorder disappears , and it wouldn &apos;t look like this , and it will be more similar to them .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it shows it .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful thing in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true inform , also is the mirror can not lie , from this true informed .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t say that you can &apos;t say a woman somewhere else .
this is what we need to understand under <unk> <unk> , again .
we need these lie to be these lie , which is the deception that we can &apos;t live on .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the <unk> , but in science , it &apos;s such a great lie .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of <unk> <unk> .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the ancestry of people .
that the person should be <unk> by the monkeys and , yeah , at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran it on her husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true what charles wrote there . &quot;
the person is supposed to be <unk> or a common ancestor .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge from their own .
why do we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge from something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live with these <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things in the world .
we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism goes awry and how the traces of the track that he leaves to do something else than this is on this great picture of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me about that .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to particularly love him because he has a propensity to get rid of it .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> at this point , there &apos;s something wrong with that .
i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral justify the <unk> because used to use , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they feel that this is the real truth behind <unk> .
you know , a little bit of a <unk> that doesn &apos;t care about <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there are no clubs that we can look at , where we can look , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing , just the fire fire .
he signed it up .
and <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t tell his teacher to say that you &apos;d like to put fire somewhere , and be happy when the fire was <unk> .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re in charge to remove the dangers of others , if they &apos;re just fire .
and here you have this little mechanism .
this one <unk> that in the heart of <unk> , that he knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that he can &apos;t say that .
and so they just get these words that we &apos;re going to use in the language of politically correct speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we tell that , the social situation is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present these things in a society that should work .
i want to give you a discussion of what we found in my institute .
after which logic , these self-deception , these self-deception , a different reality , the willingness to be aware of the unconscious , that they &apos;re valid to spread outside .
so , i want to show you two , maybe three examples of it .
the first example is , what many of you know , and some of them appreciate , and some of them don &apos;t need just to do at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such a bit intellectual , says about leibniz .
and from this soul , you know , they somehow think that they kind of <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> it in latin america , the <unk> .
and if that <unk> <unk> , then it &apos;s filled with the people , and then it &apos;s filled with the mind , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can be <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside of the world .
so we should be aware of what &apos;s really going to be present for our lives .
and if you have these assumption in front of you , you understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to experience that happiness can improve our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> to this .
you know , they &apos;re still familiar with school .
so this is a <unk> , which is a logic that describes us .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so , to lie , you can just apply these logic wrong .
in this case , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul in that way .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> has right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence in that .
i <unk> him in particular .
so a third sentence that comes immediately from people who have a strong feeling of soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yeah , in this <unk> speech , which is the expression of the expression .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences are really accurate .
well , i can say it all the time .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , then the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what it is .
i can say all the time .
but the key is if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s just true .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul in that way .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are really accurate .
and now our <unk> consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something about it .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on as would be the opposite of the first sentence already and <unk> .
because actually , we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses two sentences that are correct , and a third <unk> that looks like it would have something to do with it , we can save our <unk> .
so , we do pretend it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to keep these things in different examples .
in the present point , we have a very modern example of a modern example , which is to fill out the <unk> .
this is what you have to do with another <unk> subject , a <unk> of the philosophy of philosophy .
and that has to do with that , that we &apos;re back to the <unk> century .
there was a scholars called johannes <unk> , and after that , the <unk> <unk> named the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
so this is a <unk> thing .
and if they place exactly in the middle of two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack he was supposed to do .
so he &apos;s in the middle of the world .
this is what the <unk> was presented with .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing going on .
so only if you take a different example , if you immediately make a haystack bigger , then he doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing .
it &apos;s automatically <unk> to the right thing .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , <unk> , from the larger pile that put you immediately , and you also have to feel the feeling that you have to give a free will .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> here in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> of brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that have a wolf called wolf , and they say , sometimes , wolf <unk> , wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now , again , we can form the second sentence and say , if wolf has <unk> right now , he has no <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re now able to read in the daily newspaper is to find it in this third sentence .
and that looks about who doesn &apos;t have any <unk> , can &apos;t be beaten for his actions and claims to responsibility and claims .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
you know , actually , you &apos;d have to prove it to the fact that there is something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the first sentence is going wrong , of course , of course , the opposite of any evidence .
and now you can just do that if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , these courage are practicing to practice .
do that for example , if you see a person who you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> whatsoever .
and please use the german word for <unk> , which is called prophet .
and you can &apos;t call it that , and then it would be a little more politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> in the world .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to see one , for course , of course , that you can &apos;t prove it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem with it .
because while they &apos;re busy to make sure that they can &apos;t prove it , there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he <unk> them .
because he led them to a <unk> that he didn &apos;t even <unk> .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence of evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the need to prove the need to prove to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the way , the kind of shifting shift is the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have a chance to feel this <unk> in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy , if you don &apos;t remember it , you &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed me to ask me if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and asked me if i wanted to give a talk and give my idea .
i &apos;ve got to say , you know , you &apos;ve got to <unk> it , i fell difficult by my idea of talking about my idea .
and i may think of my <unk> , that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of the most , very many ideas .
and i was going to <unk> it in berlin in the mid- &apos; 80s because i wanted to make renewables , and that &apos;s not what i wanted to do .
there was the <unk> in the <unk> .
they were all <unk> , and the <unk> was called <unk> .
they &apos;re called <unk> .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or <unk> .
but there &apos;s something like &quot; n <unk> , &quot; which is sort of out of a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a kind of crazy <unk> system .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s grateful that he had the word back again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything left left .
but in the <unk> , it wasn &apos;t like that .
there was a way that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you thought of evil .
in fact , the place of <unk> , but it was called wind and sun and sun , and i started in the <unk> .
and yeah , many of the things that were said today , i &apos;m very , very , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve been through .
i &apos;ve worked 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s about insanity .
and then i went to <unk> <unk> , and then we have become <unk> with friends of the company that then became <unk> with the <unk> of one of the greatest <unk> of the world .
and here i brought you to a project that i want to show you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how you get too 100 percent .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where you could have a memory of your mind today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a third of a thousand people .
they have a <unk> of 15 percent of the time .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any more ?
it &apos;s just technological <unk> .
if they <unk> more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they were in <unk> our facility .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem for that .
but not , we have seven percent of europe in europe , and our net is physically seen european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , and it was <unk> , have the first contacts to start with the island , just expect .
how big , as big as a battery had to be , so you have to be like a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a hundred <unk> electric performance will be about 100 <unk> electric performance on the world .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear nuclear power stations , because it &apos;s very quickly everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to be deleted with diesel because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s going fast .
you &apos;re looking at it as a box of it .
and then it looks like this .
in that , three of the <unk> are always waiting for the <unk> , two will always wait .
yeah , so this is the one that &apos;s down there .
we &apos;ve also got very carefully data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system , or a system , which is just a <unk> system .
our goal was just to say , okay .
korea will be <unk> and the wind , sun , <unk> the burden so that they can map the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , don &apos;t have any performance at the moment , then you have to turn out the parachutes .
that means , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take the entire net .
and of course , you can only , of course , if you &apos;re in some way , in some ways .
that &apos;s what nobody has done in the world .
this is in little style , so they can also use their <unk> on a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what are they going to do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
but if you want to have multiple of these <unk> <unk> , and you should build a net , then it becomes very complicated .
it &apos;s going to be an energy fuel that is going to be a fuel fuel , then it &apos;s hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or sh , that will be it .
they &apos;re going to have to go to a <unk> , and they &apos;re not just able to balance it .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on , because with a normal , <unk> battery <unk> .
how far are you going to come from ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
that &apos;s the very first calculation of this , six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what needs to be done ?
have to negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new <unk> .
now , we were only five people to rebuild a new society .
and again , this is the plot .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green system , the green system .
that our system is also a <unk> , because we don &apos;t make 20 percent with diesel , and it &apos;s not going to be <unk> for other things .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> on the island , is meant to be great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and therefore , we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could sort of map the electrical conditions of the island of scale to three quite three .
that means we &apos;re looking for the first battery to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s <unk> from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , is <unk> in the 1970s &apos; 70s , and then <unk> , and then became <unk> on the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatts performance , and can give six hours long , and this is the battery that we sort of have <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up with it .
over here , we can simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to turn out the <unk> in the net .
and here &apos;s where you can see it again .
we can <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net of the net .
this is what we see again , again , again , again , again , again , a single bit of <unk> here .
and what we did since <unk> was the hall , then , until today , until today , all of the things that are going on between the single system of electronics to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is only between the subject battery and the theme net , and everything between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is , you know , in this island , it &apos;s basically all the <unk> that we &apos;re going to get in trouble with problems that we &apos;re going to get when we &apos;re going to increase our percentage of renewables .
so , this whole discussion , as a result , is going back and forth , <unk> , <unk> , how to go back to the island for four to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is going to give you a lot of time .
so <unk> , <unk> everywhere .
we can actually start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , because you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can <unk> through the n , you can take nets , you can &apos;t do that in any case , the percentage of <unk> , but you can never give it to memory .
and that &apos;s a little bit of the message that &apos;s the message .
so many people have come and look at this , because because you can see what &apos;s going on .
if we turn out the diesel , you don &apos;t have any more that a <unk> mass that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> , basically , is just from louder rotating masses from big power , where the wave always goes around around europe .
we look at this grid , and we look at fifty hertz , and when it &apos;s nine suggesting nine hertz , we start a few <unk> , then again , a little <unk> steam , and then we get up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
if you take it somewhere , it takes a little bit of time to do it .
the <unk> reserves at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond to other things .
if you don &apos;t have it anymore , this spinning mass , then you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> this with this big battery of two milliseconds .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> that you see in there .
and the message is , now , we have to give mass mass to this rotating mass , if we just have our goals to 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to achieve that .
then we have to break down our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t know , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can break down the capacity to break down the <unk> capacity by the net .
now , there &apos;s now a whole bunch of studies that have been <unk> .
and at that point , people always come and look at our <unk> , and look at our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you <unk> a bit of the future .
and lots of discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years .
not , there &apos;s no tragedy , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never been counting .
we &apos;ve got 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to get the same capacity in the next 30 years that we &apos;re going to have to store the same capacity in <unk> .
very simple , that &apos;s how it gets .
there &apos;s a whole amount of <unk> and arguments that are going to be there .
the beautiful thing is , i &apos;ve experienced this in the last two years that scientists have been asking to my side .
we &apos;ve got to get over 10 million <unk> now , also , to <unk> the german web for the german net .
that &apos;s going to happen in april of april .
so , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and there &apos;s only one of these things that &apos;s going to be there , except in fact , 100 percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewables , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussions , there &apos;s always tried to do this , these <unk> , which are going to have a little net , they have nothing to do with us .
but it &apos;s very easy to ask the question , if you &apos;re completely independent , from some fossil or <unk> , who will be <unk> somewhere on the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , then you &apos;re a island .
then they just use what the sun and wind there is where they live .
and this is sort of a little bit of our vision of a <unk> nuclear energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that you &apos;ve said , &quot; well , that &apos;s how you use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and in that way , also the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can again be a collective and the sun , and it &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet , and you can also have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty much <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
thank you .
as steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , homeless , homeless , homeless who had just been two strings of strings .
nathaniel left juilliard , a <unk> <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , two years ago in walt disney hall .
he just had a show of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> note about yo-yo lewis and hillary clinton on how the dodgers never made it in the baseball world , and all of this because of the <unk> passage of the first violin of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel were interested in <unk> .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel were told a medical treatment because he was already treated with electric electricity and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that had been tracking his whole life .
and in exactly such a <unk> , nathaniel , when we started with our first class in walt disney hall , and he started to get this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked totally lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how to poison someone in their sleep .
so i just started playing a little bit of this .
i played the first sentence by beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , there was a complete change .
it was as if he was under the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction that was catalyst to my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , he started playing his violin , and i started playing a few clips from <unk> , and asked me to finish them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , started by bach about beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a <unk> knowledge of music , but it was also a tight personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music , he was talking about music , <unk> man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music is changing .
nathaniel means a <unk> of emotional health .
because the music allows him to give him his thoughts and delusions with their imagination and creativity in a real way .
and so he <unk> his <unk> condition .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
so this is why we &apos;re doing music : so we &apos;re doing something that is in all of us , deep inside our feelings , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity lens .
and the reality of this expression is all of us , and it &apos;s moving , and it &apos;s inspired , and it &apos;s <unk> .
so , what &apos;s going on in nathaniel was the music coming back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him who recognized his talent and <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to go again with nathaniel music , no matter whether in walt disney <unk> hall , or <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> of <unk> .
i hope you &apos;re sorry .
so i knew many fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , this was a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
more better , he was bred in <unk> after the allegedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could think of it as a result of selling it .
i had this beauty with a relationship about several months .
one day , the head of the company said , and i asked if i could tell in an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this incredible problem is for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been the oceans six years old as we &apos;ve beaten away .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction of it .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left about it .
so probably or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
lots of arguments about it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not sustainable .
not taste very well .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right now .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of pr for the company .
let &apos;s don &apos;t stop it .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for being able to grow out in the ocean that you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
the best in the industry .
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one what ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that evening i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , short before the event , don &apos;t stop .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to be an election .
well , i <unk> with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a decent answer , until i finally returned to the senior biologists .
let &apos;s don &apos;t call it a <unk> .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , fragments , fragments and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
the assumption is two percent of the time .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> and a <unk> .
that &apos;s me , you know ?
no , i actually got <unk> from this fish because , i swear to god , that fish tasted after this conversation tasted after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know that you know , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish .
it &apos;s <unk> us .
he came to the table with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
hold twice .
in fact , he was still delicious .
who can leave a fish so well after it was going to be <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were growing <unk> on what was basically the wetlands .
they did it by <unk> the country .
they built this complicated suite of canals , and they kept pushing water out of the country and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that worked , not economically .
and downtown it was a catastrophe to it .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds in the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought green the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water <unk> .
they literally have the lever up .
instead of <unk> water , they used the canals to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a 11,000 hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company , the ecological destruction completely opposite .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they look out on the horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and that density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time in front of them .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought us through the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> <unk> until my knees , and <unk> a <unk> .
this is what he pulled out of a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , he sees a pattern of concentration that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> <unk> has spent the largest part of his career in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on our relations with relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and picks up a little bit of rare birds and algae and funny <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was faint about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do you taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is that <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a beautiful system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
in the moment , it was as if a director would require a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker <unk> , a literally pinker carpet carpet so far .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well last year , this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private transportation systems in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not powerful .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and the pinker on the pinker the limb is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that is measuring their own success in the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , these <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 kilometers away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they fly 240 miles into the farm .
and every night , they fly 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing this because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of the penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , are you going to fly 240 miles to the farm and fly 240 miles back at night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i quoted a song from the whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste of it .
i almost never cook it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t freak out at all .
she liked sweet and <unk> as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge of it .
it &apos;s the last rabbit to hit something in the body .
it &apos;s developed throughout evolution for <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that &apos;s <unk> their success on their own .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he <unk> huge , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are the things that rivers tend to do with themselves , chemical pollutants , chemical pollutants , <unk> <unk> .
and when it &apos;s fought by the system , and this leaves the water clean , the water is clean than it is .
the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water .
because when the water <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do that , because this love love , like romantic also , is also <unk> .
you could say they &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , in the food of food .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit more radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we &apos;re eating organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that the future of good food represents someone somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest with that .
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to grow the world more than only .
a billion people are starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years .
the grain of herbivores to herbivores , <unk> on the earth , chicken on fish , chicken on fish , and all the time has been asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the reason . it was the justify . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that allows the fast <unk> capital that allows that production .
this is not an <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , and not by <unk> and nets , but by fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves to ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions to empower each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines stand in it , and it never produces something really good for food .
but instead , let &apos;s look at the green model .
this is the one that <unk> two billion years ago .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
companies that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , instead of trying to restore , rather than <unk> , farmers who are growing up as much intense , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the experts who are also experts in the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m really honest , it &apos;s a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , this is me right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter for a certain cause of death , say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
it &apos;s because in the <unk> , the people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here on the <unk> .
we can move one step further and see the data and see that data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we &apos;re going to go further and close to age , we say , 40 years or younger , we &apos;ll see that accidents are even the leading cause for people to worry about .
and whoever <unk> is that this is particularly true in men .
so you can see that the data of information and data in this way is remembered in a lively <unk> .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not also make content in the world ?
now what we have here is the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk to my career in your suite .
with <unk> , they can dive in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year of life .
you can jump directly to a certain output .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a fan of armstrong , so i &apos;m going to click on this , and i &apos;m going to show you all expenses in which donation comics will be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , &quot; okay , what if i look at all the topic of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and go back to the point of view .
now , i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that , that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t look at it , you don &apos;t look at it .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now , i want to go through this idea of doing something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took each one of them , and we took them down to a little summary .
and the summary contains a quick <unk> and a symbol of what it comes from .
i just just show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in that strictly , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are popular at wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of the government .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen government &apos; government , i know that the <unk> , which is most of the time , is called &quot; people &apos; year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that it &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s only to realize if you look at a step back and look at the whole thing .
now , in a particular demonstration , i can go back to time in time with time <unk> &quot; people &apos; year , &quot; and everybody together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize for a ted prize .
so we can jump and throw a look at every ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re surfing on the net the first time as if it &apos;s really a net , not only from side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise would be .
and i just just show you the new york times the website of that .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with every single website -- and we get these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step and jump directly into a specific <unk> .
so this is important because you just look at the websites in this way of looking at the websites in this way , and that can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain time .
here &apos;s the final demonstration of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve given to here .
and i can kind of look at what i &apos;ve looked at today , again .
and , if i go back to a step and look at everything , i can organize my past , maybe after my <unk> . here , i &apos;ve been looking for the past to be <unk> , and here , for bing , , or here to live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and come back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
if we can do this , this will be <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we experience knowledge , maybe we can actually pull out of it .
so i &apos;m going to hear a little bit about that .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school every day , every day one hour per day .
and my nose always put in a book in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in other worlds , and in <unk> , my deep in me , voracious curiosity <unk> .
i was completely <unk> , you know ?
it always went to try to understand the world and explore the boundaries of the possible explore .
and my love for science fiction seemed to mirror in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world presented with miracles that we never have before .
now , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing in the <unk> room .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video video games still , and there were still the whole images in the media media project , and i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do at all . if we read a book as children , we took the description of the <unk> and projected the canvas in our heads .
my reaction to this was drawing and painting by aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all this stuff .
in the <unk> , i was constantly caught by teachers like me , hidden textbook , hidden <unk> .
creativity had to be out of this .
and something interesting happened , which was interesting to me , which was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows the idea of a totally unknown world here on our earth .
certainly , i would never be able to do a alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually actually enter , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic like all of what i &apos;ve been reading when i was reading these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to be divers .
the only problem in canada was i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t even let myself know .
i <unk> my father , until he finally met a <unk> in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years that &apos;s been <unk> now , i spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , how we really can &apos;t imagine .
nature is not aware of nature &apos;s imagination , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
i feel deepest awe at what i see in my dives today .
and my love is holding the ocean with the same intensity as ever .
and then when i was a kid , when i was <unk> a profession , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed the best way to tell my inner ability to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew comic books all the time .
so , films were the way to bring images and stories together . this is fit together .
of course , the stories i <unk> was from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could get my preference for the <unk> and connecting the filmmaking .
so , basically , my two passions are <unk> .
something interesting happened to happen in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to create as a kind of liquid <unk> of this film , and we &apos;ve been attacked on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and what came out of it was the first <unk> <unk> that ever had to see in a film .
now , the film didn &apos;t bring any money to the film , right , he just played his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience in the world was <unk> from the magic that went from it .
according to arthur clarke , the law of <unk> technology , and magic is not different from each other .
so you saw a bit of magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting thing to do .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really what needs to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much more .
together with <unk> , we created the guys out of liquid metal , and the success was all about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world of creativity , a very new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company together with my good friend stan swings , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was that , the phase of analog processes with visual <unk> , etc . , and start to start with digital <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did , and then we did an advantage for a while .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- what we &apos;ve done -- what we &apos;ve got to do is slow down .
but the bar hit beautiful . and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film over the big ship , which is going to end .
i was selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship called romeo and julia , a <unk> <unk> order , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to <unk> the real <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them , by the way , i said , &quot; we dip to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to it again that the imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic by a <unk> .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that blew my mind .
and the amount of comfort that we &apos;ve been doing is enormous . we had to build cameras and light together .
and i noticed how much this <unk> , a <unk> species , was <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> , and they were also <unk> <unk> .
you go up into these capsule , then you go down into this dark , <unk> environment , where you don &apos;t get hope on saving , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same way i would be in a <unk> .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , with the part that curiosity and science has been . it was all . it was a adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give for hollywood .
because , you know , i could think of a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got to do , and i wanted to do it .
and so , then i met a little bit of an unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and will <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the <unk> , and we explored with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look at <unk> and looking at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the <unk> . you didn &apos;t have a means of technology , so we developed the technology .
now , here i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite similar to these <unk> , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> to the <unk> of the ship .
i just <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
so the set of the set of the ship is an exact copy of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and it made me realize that you can use this <unk> , that you can use such a <unk> and the way that your consciousness is in the vehicle in that other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and perhaps a little bit of a glimpse of what might happen in a few decades when you have <unk> to explore something or other things , in all kinds of things that i can imagine as a <unk> .
and after these expeditions , we started to appreciate what we saw there , to learn , for example , to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , which are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based on sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees c that they can survive there .
in the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
that &apos;s fascinating .
but at the end , it ran out that i took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
and we worked with documentaries , but they actually run science , sort of , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , then as a child , and the execution of the reality .
in the course of this discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot of time .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i think you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director must also lead to a leader like a <unk> or something .
i don &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t make us any money .
we &apos;re going to play a little bit of the <unk> , not a trace .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all done these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no harm , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked on the years , and sometimes we were working two to three months in a row .
and in this community , you realize the most important thing is that you have the most important thing that you have to have , because you &apos;ve managed to overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to my next film to the avatar , i tried to use the same leadership , which is trying to use the same leadership , which is to respected his team and bring themselves to return .
and it really changed the dynamics of that .
so i stood back with a small team on <unk> terrain , and we went &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
extremely exciting .
it &apos;s a huge challenge .
and we &apos;ve been in a third of a half years of a four years ago .
it changed my way of making films , completely .
there were people who said we were really <unk> these <unk> and transported on the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we say from all of that ?
what do we learn to do ?
so , first of all , i think that &apos;s a curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality of reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all of the <unk> in the world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me an advice as i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry about themselves .
you get other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not alternative . &quot;
but in art , in study and in study , failure needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
no important venture , the innovation called innovation , was ever done without risk .
you have to be prepared to take risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear but not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise may be something that i think is mainly because of the foundation of the foundation mostly about vaccines and seeds around the things that we have to invent and deliver the poorest two billion dollars a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> <unk> over many years is not growing . it &apos;s too much or little rain . the things are going to change how they can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , the climate is going to become terrible for you .
it &apos;s also very important for them to be <unk> .
the fact is , if you could reduce the price of one thing , the <unk> would be far away from the most effective .
well , the <unk> is fallen over the time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> started the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price half , we &apos;re going to put it in a new barrier and a barrier and it depends on co2 .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
well , the exact link between a <unk> and the following <unk> , and where they &apos;re <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some butler , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are . but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to near zero ?
not half the one or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than say , we have a <unk> <unk> truck that needs to be under a three meter bridge under a three feet .
this one needs to go down to zero .
well , we run a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons every year , from 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of each other on the planet .
and somehow we have to produce changes that reduce that to zero .
it &apos;s been up to the same thing .
only different economic changes have been influenced by it , and we have to go through <unk> increase and reduce in a reduction to zero .
so let &apos;s look at each factor of one factor , and think of how we get that .
one of those numbers must be very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people live .
and it turns out to be on nine billion <unk> to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could probably reduce about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we see a slope around 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes everything , the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and <unk> means to make these services almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
here we see a very basic service . are there at home light , so you can read your homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that is not rising .
because of various successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods in <unk> , there are many services that have a lot of services to reduce the energy of a few services .
in other services like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 larson : <unk> -- <unk> -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; amp ; d or <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , is a lot smaller for improvement .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may be able to have a factor of three or maybe a factor of six or maybe a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now now from 26 billion of the time to go down 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going on per unit of energy .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get that to zero .
if they burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , you &apos;re not .
almost every single one of the <unk> for electricity today is co2 except renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
now , when i use &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
and the internet and the service is a miracle .
people here contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
they don &apos;t usually have a <unk> that needs a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re going to get it wrong , and some of them are not .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in a very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really bring this into ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that the idea of people on here ?
i remembered last year when i took mosquitoes and somehow they liked people .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what i fell with .
i decided that this was the <unk> of fireflies my favorite contribution to the environment .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies in the world .
you told me they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they all don &apos;t get much more .
we need solutions , either one or multiple that have a unique scale and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there &apos;s a lot of directions in which people can look for this big demands .
i have floods , fusion , fusion , biofuels and biofuels .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something like literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so , that &apos;s a hard thing to do .
next , <unk> .
and then what do you do with garbage ?
because it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and you should be able to work on that .
the last three of the five of the five things i &apos;ve put in .
it &apos;s renewable energy , as often as they are called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that these technologies make dramatically less than the power of power .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more than a normal power station .
also , these sources of <unk> are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and the wind will not go all the time .
that &apos;s why you have to depend on these sources , and you have to have a way of being able to get out of the energy , even if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s a huge amount of <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they have to deal with the risk of where it comes from .
and there &apos;s a little bit of time .
so we need a huge breakthrough here , something that will be 100 times better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy to do it .
and that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources of data over 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the time .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach to the case ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need to have at least 100 people .
you &apos;ll say , you know , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are many people who are already involved in it .
bill grand has a lot of companies , among other things called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company , which is maybe surprisingly , a nuclear approach to the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a couple of time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are overhead .
the <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea of it .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the <unk> is a lot better .
you &apos;re actually burning the trash , and you can actually use the waste of these reactors as a <unk> .
instead of breaking out the head , they burn it just . a great thing .
so the uranium is going to use incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; a single wave of <unk> . &quot;
it really solves the <unk> of it .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you look at <unk> cheap and simple <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s still many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to need to get forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like this ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we &apos;re getting there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something else , and hopefully something . hopefully <unk> and cement is clean .
so , to reach those 80 percent , the developed developed world , including countries like china , completely change their <unk> .
the other grade says if we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s going to be a key feature of this .
when we go back from there , how would the 2020 look like this ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to bring reduction on the way . the less we <unk> , the lower will be the <unk> and also the temperature .
we need to follow these breakthroughs with <unk> , and that &apos;s what we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books in this subject .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> &apos;s energy <unk> , the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed wide , because we need support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very <unk> wish is that we invent this technology .
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to use it for more research .
if countries are hitting themselves in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t only talk about co2 .
they should talk these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous small funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to control carbon dioxide , carbon &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to do dialogue , and we need to lead to the whole thing that &apos;s done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of these investment ?
the hard step is to find the first one of the first <unk> to find more billion , and the place that actually builds the first one of them .
once the first thing done , when it &apos;s done , it &apos;s all very clear , and then it &apos;s all very clear , because the distribution , the energy density is so different than <unk> , as we know .
to understand that right now , this means to build deep into the ground almost like a vertical plank of nuclear <unk> , and then the process goes up , and then the process goes up and works further ?
<unk> : right . now , you have to get the reactor up now , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and see things like <unk> or <unk> . that &apos;s not good .
if you have a very cheap fuel fuel , you can think about it for 60 years -- think about a column -- which you &apos;re buried with , without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that offers a solution to the waste of garbage .
<unk> : yeah . well , now what happens to the garbage : you can sit it down -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- then they take him and put it in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by taking out the waste that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> on these reactors . this is our <unk> .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which is what we fill in with our reactors , and that &apos;s going to reduce dramatically dramatically during this process .
but while you &apos;ve been talking about different people in this world , you know ?
where &apos;s the biggest interest in what really really makes it happen ?
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is another one of the things that was made .
it &apos;s a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who has implemented a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your sense , time : time and probability will really make a difference in life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , and we &apos;ve got 20 years to produce it and then for 20 years .
this is sort of the <unk> that has shown us the <unk> that we need to <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be easily .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of thousands of companies , and we need hundreds of them to work for their pilots to work .
and it would be best when it comes to multiple , because then you could use a mixture of it .
in every case , we need a solution .
dates of the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would be that without the <unk> , but it &apos;s still so much more important .
there &apos;s other innovative companies in the nuclear sector .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be a little difficult , but maybe say that about us .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need to initiate <unk> to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much heart , and what do you do ? you might have a heart attack or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is related to different techniques to delay warming , so we would give 20 or 30 years to get us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you don &apos;t hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , &quot; you shouldn &apos;t only be working on insurance because one that may be lazy , so you still eat because you know that one will save the <unk> .
<unk> : have you got one or two sentences to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are going to move things out of the clouds ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , from which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you &apos;re paying for a lot later .
the fact is that this uncertainty is supposed to be worried .
<unk> : well , the actual cost for research -- say , we should spend the u.s. to spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
there should be other things between other things .
you get to big <unk> , and here you can disagree with sensible people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funded only the learning curve . i think we should try to be more expensive , which is the potential to be much cheaper .
if the <unk> <unk> you get a very high <unk> , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking about it .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why don &apos;t we talk more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to do because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very rare group , and so he &apos;s going to bring it to the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate for the appropriate ones .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it is to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> needs to be the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti viruses , about 20 billion tape , about a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s really hard because people are pushing to work very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i thought it was sort of turned into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
usually , most people start <unk> themselves on the task of work .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
then you invest a little bit in planning and organization . it &apos;s drawing and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re going to invest a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> .
and finally , before they have no time , someone takes the marshmallow more , and they gently put it gently down the top , put a step back and say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but then , almost always , what &apos;s happening is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> is the whole thing that &apos;s going to bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more <unk> than others , and among the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the best are a fresh student of <unk> .
and this is quite amazing .
as peter told us , they &apos;re not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structure of all .
what you might be asking is : how does this happen ? why ? what ?
and peter told me , &quot; none of the kids spend time in the head of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re not investing in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason for that .
and that was that <unk> was trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then he <unk> him .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
so , what &apos;s different is that you start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so that you have a lot of times to repair <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as the heart of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every time the kids get immediate feedback , the kids will work immediately and what not .
so the performance to work with prototypes is essential -- but see how different teams are acting .
most of the average people are doing about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , <unk> something more , but not much , <unk> , better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful thing ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to stable structures .
ceos are something about average , but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you take an <unk> administrator on the team , you will significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this happening ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team that <unk> and looking at work is going to dramatically improve the performance of the team .
and they have specialized skills and <unk> skills and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams who are typical of the typical , you get about six , the stable structures .
so i tried something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the same thing in the world .
so i offered a <unk> version of software for the winner .
what do you think it was about these <unk> ?
what was the result of that ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a <unk> high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> has a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
what happened to you now ?
now she understood the advantage of shifting prototyping .
so the same , bad team became one among the best .
they produced the highest construction in the same time .
so , there &apos;s <unk> lessons for us , the nature of drive and success .
you like to ask , why would someone actually invest in a business system ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to create teams to help teams , cars , video games and create <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> does is they help to identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or positions , or to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , that simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in being able to visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they &apos;re finding crazy examples from all the world people <unk> the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the most compelling lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it demands that we &apos;re all going to take our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking of how our feelings and our job , in the challenge that lies before us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all about what it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to give us a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s do this as a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
and i ask myself what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends in a last time , and they wanted to go all in the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter , or america &apos;s <unk> .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re <unk> to be <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that you ever have on this planet -- health , wealth , mobility , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time to do this .
my <unk> died every time they were 60 .
my grandparents recovered this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be a better one at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world has 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve created the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases exist , the millions of us have just threatened a generation , hardly even .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes in scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and see things , if it works , if it doesn &apos;t work , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in this world go hungry every day .
that number rises , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t go from this chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it &apos;s done .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they &apos;re not destroying at the same time .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this one keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night , we never needed scientific progress yet .
and we &apos;ve never been able to be able to do it , as we can do today .
people reveal themselves in their faith , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right way of thinking about progress .
but do you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
they &apos;re not right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to find out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about immunization for the new yorker , a small article .
and i was amazed to get resistance to the resistance of what &apos;s going on at the end of the most effective economy in health care in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon i wrote an article about genetically modified foods .
the same thing is , only bigger .
people played crazy .
so i was also writing about an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were a certain kind of random kind of <unk> <unk> in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were nuts were actually not <unk> at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and it brought me so mess .
but then i thought , well , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic with little quotes about it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons for that , and i think we know what these are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , mass destruction , 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed they were always right now . be skeptical .
ask questions , you demand evidence , you demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you take evidence of it , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell that from the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear as i haven &apos;t seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which was the <unk> with measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
many studies have been done to see if that was true .
a lot of studies should be done , which is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see , what we really feel .
we don &apos;t think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
<unk> because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which the <unk> are falling for measles .
that &apos;s <unk> , and we should be ashamed of that .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
because does anybody have measles ?
is there any one in the audience ever seen anyone dying of measles ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 160,000 times the world &apos;s last year .
these are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can <unk> it , and people like jenny are able to walk around and walk messages from fear and illiteracy and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no cure , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he just developed a couple of other people to develop a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , this is good , except for paul <unk> and vaccines and says how valuable they are , and people just should stop <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist of the time .
if paul was talking in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t talk without <unk> <unk> .
he gets phone calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need it , but vaccines are essential .
so you continue to take it back , and you go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;ve got measles now in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago i wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , i think i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child to <unk> . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe someone went into lagos tonight in a plane and flying on los angeles , right now , he &apos;s at ohio right now .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he will visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to reveal ourselves in lying . we love that .
did you have all your vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you on the jumps .
i know they &apos;ve done that because half of americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data will put it all over .
they make their urine . they almost never do it .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i completely agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
we shouldn &apos;t . we should not . our healthcare system is suffering .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> itself to us that it can afford .
so we &apos;re going to run away from that , and where do we work ?
we &apos;re running in the arms of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little spears here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we give billions of dollars to make it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream to me and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the <unk> that says , &quot; hmm , i will not adopt the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> , &quot; or any <unk> that would treat the patient with <unk> .
if you &apos;re going to go to this way , where believe and magic are replacing evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 to their people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can break from aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be worse than each other from this disease .
tell me not that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re doing right now is this absurd battle between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> foods and <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . she has to stop it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every single <unk> , every branch of the branch , everybody <unk> , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there were no <unk> in the world .
there was no <unk> whatsoever . we did it all done .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 35 years .
and some of them worked out , and some of them don &apos;t .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to improve their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand it .
we clearly genetically modified food in the world .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re <unk> .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
there &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid it &apos;s a real <unk> , and it &apos;s keeping millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
these investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need this , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
the name is something that is food half a billion people .
it &apos;s about like a potato .
it &apos;s just a pool of calories . it &apos;s unconscious .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to you is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to continue to do something , we &apos;re guilty of something guilty that we think we want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of ours , and we have to do it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; well , do you still want to do this ridiculous time , and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to be in every case .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to be <unk> , and we will move it where we want .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we &apos;re going to go into the time machine , we will be happy to have this .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , i know what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
a deception is true to something , because someone knows that .
so we also understand each other , so i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that was at least since the 1950s in every <unk> of children .
i myself learned him from the <unk> magic magic of <unk> magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m going to explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i will just hold the knife in my hands .
i push my sleeves back .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;ll just get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to do anything . as long as i &apos;m here , nothing can move into my sleeve or get out of it .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the knife will hit by my bare physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually very clear to his place that i can shake it without the knife to fall .
nothing goes in my sleeve or come out , not <unk> . and they can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
now , many of you probably know a lot of them in the room .
so he &apos;s working on this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the real mystery in the illusion of illusion .
in the moment , where i &apos;m going to <unk> my hand from you , so you see it moving from the back , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position that he was so extended .
amazing trick ?
there &apos;s someone in the back of the world who had no childhood .
so he &apos;s here . right ?
and when i <unk> , the fingers of his position changes .
but that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing right now , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by me , it &apos;s going to be hidden through this movement that the fingers are <unk> again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that trick you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really blew me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing to me .
and what it turns out is , if you offer a placebo to a white pill , in the shape of a white pill , the shape of a <unk> , is just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give it to placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter , and it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , though , though not any <unk> -- is just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take fragments , it &apos;s still more effective than pills each other .
a <unk> capsule that is yellow at a end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
and the dose is also a role for me .
one pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics -- i &apos;m sorry now .
but the key thing is , ...
... that &apos;s the idea of playing a matter of life .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to get to a needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance that you injected to a patient .
it &apos;s a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill don &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which is not as good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t look like a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem so good like the needle .
and none of them have really a really <unk> property , and it &apos;s just our faith in which a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something that obviously is a deception , and let it look real .
we know in the study that you need to reach to a needle when it &apos;s supposed to go to the needle .
this is an <unk> long <unk> . it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to <unk> them a little bit a little bit .
this is really my flesh , and it &apos;s not <unk> special , <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special deal of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to drop this needle into my skin , and i &apos;m going to go through it until it <unk> the other side .
if you &apos;re <unk> -- if you drop out -- i showed you a few friends in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman almost <unk> .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re quickly <unk> , and look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part of the back sensitive to the back .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also <unk> , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little <unk> .
am i really sorry . does it make that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of a little bit of my skin , and on the other side , it &apos;s a little bit out .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the <unk> of the world .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think of if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not as dumb and <unk> yourself the skin , just to talk about a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show it to you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back the back , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it right now . &quot;
people in the <unk> are now going to be in it .
so let me show you a little bit about that .
this is really my skin , which is not a special deal of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , look at it .
okay , let me take a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
usually i would take a needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds of it .
but i think in this frame here , and with intent from a deception , i &apos;m going to just let the needle just go there and go out of the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re excited about it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have a couple of people who have been covered by happiness that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and they had a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in that .
everybody would like to be happier .
but despite all these tide systems , there are several cognitive falls , which are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is primarily about these cognitive fall .
these are <unk> <unk> , which are thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists that are thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just so mess as everyone else .
the first one of these falls is a <unk> , <unk> complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could reduce it , but in large and all the stuff we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a case of experience and memory : basically , they &apos;re just between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being , without the significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and then he added , really , really emotional , that &apos;s all the experience of the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what was destroyed was the memories of the experience .
he had been the experience of that .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t count because he was <unk> with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what it really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in terms of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present , and the present thing is capable of experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to <unk> it here ? &quot;
or , how was their journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and to confuse the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing stories to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we need to keep with our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example of what &apos;s going on .
there &apos;s an old study in the world .
these are real patients who participate in a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go to the detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they asked them , &quot; who would have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question to do .
patient b is clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient has a patient b b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient has a lot worse <unk> than patient b had to be a patient .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very <unk> or great -- but one of them is the clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other one .
and the worse , the worse , where the pain was at the end , it &apos;s a bad story . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people for their <unk> , and also later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse than a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
in view of the <unk> self , b was clearly an worse time .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
so what &apos;s a story about that ?
and that &apos;s true for stories that give us memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
and it &apos;s a history of change , significant moments , significant moments and end .
well , end up , it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , it &apos;s <unk> .
well , the <unk> self lives its life continuously .
there &apos;s moments of <unk> , one after another .
and they ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re still lost .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> of self .
and yet , they &apos;re going to get the idea that they should count that what &apos;s happening during these moments of <unk> .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in this world .
and as we use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that &apos;s going to keep the <unk> self for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
in view of the <unk> self , if you have a holiday and the second week , it &apos;s twice as good as the first one , the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s how it works at all the time for the <unk> .
for the <unk> self , a little bit better than <unk> vacation , because there are no new memories of being added .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self , which is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> self is more than remember and telling stories .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a <unk> memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which is kind of like the <unk> self of experiences that don &apos;t need to have the <unk> self .
i have the impression that if we rush vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , which means we &apos;re doing vacation in the service of the <unk> self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the <unk> .
and i &apos;ve probably gone from my memories to this <unk> journey , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve opened the folder with 600 images , i would have spent another hour of it .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half a time .
there &apos;s a disagreement that seems to be <unk> .
so i want you to think about a trial experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , you know that at the end of the <unk> all your images , and you get a <unk> drug , so you get a <unk> drug , so you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose to pick the same vacation up ?
why we choose to choose the <unk> that we pick up with a choice between the two kinds of self .
well , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to , one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> themselves ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured in the world ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of <unk> even over time .
if you ask the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing to do .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who is not different of these terms is going to screw the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers talking about well-being for happiness , which are <unk> for happiness in exactly this way .
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness of the <unk> self has been realized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be trying to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has been asked a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson that we think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty to do with it .
they &apos;ve got so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what the happiness of <unk> is .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s a dominant thing to be done .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you will be able to do very different things .
so the conclusion of what i said here is , what i said here is that we don &apos;t really want to think of happiness as a replacement replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different idea of that .
well , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t think about the same things if we think about life , and when we actually think about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you have to think that people have to be happier if they say , say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up with california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are going to move to california in the hope of being happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that way .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , how terrible the weather in ohio was , and you feel that they &apos;re feeling the right decision in ohio .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you an idea of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we came up with a couple of weeks ago , there was a pretty interesting outcome that gave me a pretty interesting outcome that came from this <unk> survey .
is this something that you can share with us because you have a couple of minutes to have a couple of minutes from here ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found this in terms of happiness in the <unk> .
if we look at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under 50 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a huge representative sample , under 600,000 dollars in a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they become more happy , and they become more happy .
and we get an absolutely flat line of it .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen that flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money is going to release no <unk> , but that lack of money to buy one misery of certainly misery , and we can measure this misery very clearly .
in the sense of other self , the <unk> self , they get a different story .
the more money you deserve to be happier .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american efforts , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to take everything on your head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance to be able to use the politicians that would actually take a <unk> like that , and make politics based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slow into the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s just happening and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
people are able to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study <unk> or whether they want to study <unk> , so we have to take this discussion pretty soon .
how you improve happiness can be very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self , or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , it seems to me , or at least the most interesting political debate is to follow the most interesting political debate over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to do it as easy to save the world in reality , how they &apos;re saving in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including everybody , to spend more time with the play greater and more <unk> .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
in fact , in my research at the institute of the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week aren &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i calculated that it &apos;s taken time at 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i think games are so vital for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he had a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might be able to get some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , and <unk> concentration in a really difficult problem .
and if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , which are up up up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a called <unk> .
oh , you know , you know . ok . so we have some gamers here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive , that you didn &apos;t know before it was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if they reach it , they shocked them to actually be able to do this . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player &apos;s a little bit about a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces in the world , if we take the barriers to the next century , when we take the booms to the next century , the face of all <unk> <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; living in life , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m in life , i &apos;m bad at the <unk> .
this is an graffiti in my former home home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we studied why we &apos;re better in games than in real life .
so this is a problem that a lot of players have been doing .
we think that we &apos;re not so good at reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though this is heard .
we &apos;re getting more <unk> . i &apos;m very good at the context of motivation , and i &apos;m doing something that is inspired by the motivation , inspired by collaboration .
and in reality , if we go to obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t have it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think about , you know , you could not just reach everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from games to reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for the collective problem-solving problem .
and i noticed a couple of things to be able to do it in <unk> .
so first of all , if you get in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to get you a <unk> mission , right ?
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so you do that .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their ability , they have to work . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and <unk> . there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
and there &apos;s lots of staff .
and where they &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
this is not as easy as we &apos;re in real life , that feeling that in a <unk> lots of employees are willing to be ready .
and also , this epic story , that inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have defined by &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; and &quot; + an intelligence &quot; and &quot; + an intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
and if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk and a crazy idea , and a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of <unk> as world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying , at any time on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we should rather spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> , <unk> million years , spent the virtual problems of solving virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad about that .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , <unk> million years ago started to go upright with our first <unk> .
so the first way in the body .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play with play , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out , it turns out that we use this whole time to play all the time on the game , actually , what we &apos;re doing as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves , and we &apos;re going to develop a lot of things .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s the truth .
if you look at this interesting statistic that &apos;s recently published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man of today has been published in a country with intense <unk> spent 10,000 hours with <unk> <unk> .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number from two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that they spend in school from fifth grade school -- if you never miss .
so , we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> on the young people who learn what it means to be a good player , like anything else that they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know the theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours of success .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours talking about any subject to the 21st of a 21 year , we will have to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world are .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gamers <unk> ? &quot;
because if we could find this out , we would have never been able to have a <unk> human potential .
so many people currently have in the world at least one hour in the world who spend at least an hour per day .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and over the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> to save energy and work on <unk> , rather than <unk> , and in india , and china , china , can play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players in this way .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it &apos;s like to master these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> <unk> is .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately , to have a twist together , with thinking that we have an attempt to succeed .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we might like people more than we played with them , even if they defeated .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone &apos;s game .
we trust that someone has time to spend time with us that we have the same goal , and we have the same goal to stay with .
so the <unk> is able to grow the size of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of that , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours play a week , sort of like <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at doing hard to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings work optimal when we do hard , we &apos;re doing hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right job .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
gamers love to become part of an awe of <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to the right light . you know , you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest landmark of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information across the world of warcraft as well as any other subject in every other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is they think they can change virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
his work is great . he study why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to see the witnesses from not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds . &quot;
and that from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that , in fact , that makes sense , because players can reach more than the real life .
they can make stronger social bonds as a real life in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says , &quot; well , it &apos;s completely logical that gamers are more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes out of an event , the 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> , there was <unk> .
and that was sort of the first one of people &apos;s first developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> games , games were invented , sort of <unk> , in the kingdom of famine .
there was such a huge famine that the king of <unk> decided to have a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , and a national strategy , and a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so very fascinating to be in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating , and <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived that famine for 18 years by eating their famine and ate the next one .
so , i think we &apos;re going to be playing games today .
we &apos;re putting games in order to escape the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games in order to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s really satisfying in real life , and we &apos;ll get us to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end of it .
that &apos;s the exciting one .
according to 18 years after 18 years , famine didn &apos;t get better . so the king decided the king was a <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and they were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they went out and went to search for a new home for a new home , and they were just going to go back so many people , like eating food , looking for the rest after a area where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but <unk> <unk> shows that the <unk> that started the roman empire , which was the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently came to think that <unk> &apos;s &quot; crazy story &quot; is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global health system that could explain almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so , this crazy story could be true .
you might actually have saved their people by playing 18 years by playing for for 18 years , and then they had these <unk> and so much about what they learned , that they &apos;ve rescued all the civilization .
so , that &apos;s what we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing out since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;re playing <unk> for 16 years of warcraft .
i &apos;m willing to say , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be able to <unk> that half an hour a day with play , until we solved the problems of the real world .
and i know they &apos;re going to ask them , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and exactly this question i &apos;ve been devoted to doing my work for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , which is how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future of the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome , and then people empower this idea in reality .
we &apos;re asking ourselves epic wins and giving people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
this is the game of 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that needs to be solved by a <unk> .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; let &apos;s go from oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go on .
find out how to survive . most of our players are doing <unk> behavior .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger job for the next <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to put it up as a result .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute of the future .
the point is the calculation is a <unk> that people have just left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to sound , to sign up , we &apos;ve made almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; of the <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it gives us the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , the scientists , the <unk> , and just together they can save the world .
8,000 players playing this game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they read &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we put on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
now , if you close the game , you get the award of social <unk> , at 2010 .
we work with universities in across sub-saharan africa and store to learn social redesign .
we have a comic book . we &apos;ve got to understand the level high , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all around the world , especially in <unk> that benefit from their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up with the end .
i want to ask you something about it .
what do you think happens next to the next thing ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to relate to tight social networks , <unk> and desire to make meaning .
i really hope that we play the major games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design that play with me as a result of that .
when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things , i &apos;m sure that we can create any future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start with the <unk> games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what happened to me a few months ago for <unk> wired .
i always had my <unk> writing at writing , but i was talking about text texts already , and i noticed that i was never going to have ever been told in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; . &quot;
i read to you the point of view .
<unk> : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the output has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s , when i first started to build elementary school and started to build my self outside of my family context and shape , also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use <unk> in the time .
if i would take this point seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me as a person , who can run positive lives , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and i expect that i find a <unk> contribution .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this poem .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words of the last two words are called &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words of the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the pronunciation is a big force , because what you &apos;re suggesting is that it can be <unk> .
so , what do we want to do -- a disabled person , or a powerful person , or a powerful person ?
to tell you a little bit more than a child , it could be enough to end up with a child , <unk> , <unk> .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open up the doors .
a person who opened the doors to me was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how they think about that , most americans didn &apos;t correct correctly , so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful colorful , and was just created for the work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
and imagine , in fact , i &apos;ve done a <unk> child with dr. p. , and so tried to stop that practice , <unk> without success .
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as powerful and powerful young girls have formed my self and i could imagine myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> human beings .
this is just an example of many of how adults can affect the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination .
but as a result , what we &apos;ve been doing is to prove <unk> examples from the <unk> , not to imagine our language , to imagine what we would all wish to do : to enable each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes , and that &apos;s caused in many cases by a technological change .
so perhaps this technological transformation , because ever , that there was always a different truth , which is that every human society can have a little bit of a <unk> and very powerful , and that the human capacity can be able to adapt to adapt our biggest plus .
but the truth is that we change us . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically physical , emotional or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
<unk> is not a obstacle that we need to be able to get more clear to our lives .
<unk> is just one of our lives .
and i &apos;m running out of <unk> as a shadow of the shadows .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seen , but he &apos;s always on me .
and i &apos;m not going to give you the effect of the impact , or the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are <unk> in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and every person is doing it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come out with <unk> or not , but we &apos;re not going to get out of it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to protect in front of <unk> , but they &apos;re also preparing to get clear to it .
and we don &apos;t really want to make our children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things to be aware of the medical fact , to be amputated , and for other social opinion , if i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to put myself apart is that the world is constantly thinking , you could describe me with this definitions .
maybe the whole concept that &apos;s just going to look at what &apos;s broken in a broken way , and how we repair that , for each individual , is a greater disability for each other .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being forever , and not all its forces and possibilities and recognize , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a people who has value for our society .
so we have to look out about the <unk> , and focus on all the parts of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s the most important thing between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , which is a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to <unk> those <unk> times or either , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the <unk> opportunities .
it may be more important to me to realize that we don &apos;t need to get rid of <unk> , but that we &apos;re open for it to hug them to give them a <unk> to put them on the <unk> , and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we &apos;re going to create it to be more natural than something natural and useful and useful and feeling , and don &apos;t feel like this .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has been noted in my eyes , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true in human character .
i would call it <unk> : not the most powerful of his way , and not the <unk> of its species , but the ones that can adapt to the best .
conflict changes creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the battle of human mind , is to transform through conflict .
so again , change and <unk> are the greatest capacity of people .
and maybe we just know what wood is about when we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps that &apos;s the point of <unk> , a sense of self , a sense of self , a sense of self .
we can give us something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> represent a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done is to believe that we should be normal .
time , who &apos;s normal in the world .
it &apos;s not normal .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical . but wouldn &apos;t it be the normal one . and would you really learn that poor person really want to learn , if you were really ?
i think that &apos;s not the case .
<unk> found out that we &apos;ve always found people from the members of our society , to be useful to be useful , and to be useful .
there &apos;s evidence of the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , and people with heavy physical injuries , and maybe that happened because the experience of life was valuable , because the experience of life was valuable for society .
they haven &apos;t seen these people as broken and useless ; they &apos;ve been treated as something special and value .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there before a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you could barely remember myself .
when i first saw her , i was brought her out of her mother &apos;s gut . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the way .
and then , of course , it &apos;s made it click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i just knew from stories of my mother about this day because i was naturally typical of my mother &apos;s birthday .
the doctor for <unk> imaging imaging my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had gone to them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had to be the <unk> , that had to be the bad news .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , how critical this factor can be for the quality of one human .
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his mind .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone has to deal with it is two different things .
and i &apos;ve been thinking about my thinking throughout time , if i had asked me to have my prostheses in the age of 15 and bone and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i really wanted to work normal at the time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen as well because i &apos;ve met so many people who opened up doors rather than people , rather than people who wanted to limit me or give me an idea .
you see , it really takes one people who shows them how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you give it to someone to activate their own , internal forces -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and you create it , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re going to open up a very good teacher .
they &apos;re teaching them to open themselves up with themselves .
the real meaning of <unk> is rooted in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential is <unk> .
again , what potential is we want to pull out of the world .
in the 1960s , in britain , one case was done in the u.k. , and then <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are divided to grades .
and that a student will tested <unk> harder , get the better teachers , etc .
they then gave them a <unk> period of students with an &quot; enough &quot; of the note &quot; very good . &quot; they were told they were very clever , and they were very clever , and after these three months they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it &apos;s going to break a heart of the heart that the rest of the <unk> was told that it &apos;s just enough .
and then it was the same for three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had <unk> school .
the key thing about this study was that teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said , &quot; they &apos;re the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students with the grade , and so they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a broken mind that was broken , has no hope anymore . he &apos;s missing no more <unk> of our natural , early <unk> and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we create it , the human mind continues to support the human mind , trying to continue to find themselves and other people around themselves , curious , and then we put our forces into really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would they want to be better than they &apos;re right now ?
assuming i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- precise , more , more and faster .
or want to be more <unk> , more power , more power .
would you like to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those things that you &apos;re going to <unk> with more creativity .
which one would they like to be the case ?
what would you like to have , if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity to me ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a couple of things , probably , about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be a good memory for a good person ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a couple less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i love that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is that just a conceit ?
or is it possible to be <unk> .
evolution is an <unk> subject here at the ted ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay on the title &quot; nothing in biology , no sense of evolution . &quot;
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it different for others , or is it relevant to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different varieties of hominids from hominids .
some of them came and gone .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we would be quite remote from the other parts of the tree , but actually the biggest mechanisms are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells pretty much .
is it clear that we can use it to use out of it and make the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> from what comes from the pancreas .
and where we talk about bacteria already , that each of us will be aware of our gut more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think antonio damasio after their own self , thinking about the bacteria ?
our gut is an incredibly <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that you could only want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> of unintended , <unk> tastes to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important to their lives .
they help the <unk> of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be able to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just <unk> -- the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s what we were doing .
this also represents the <unk> of this speech , so i hope that d ate it .
now , when i was a <unk> at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love in the power of evolution , and i made a little bit very fundamental : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will depend on both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms showed , the things started to change .
sexual reproduction is in the image of freedom .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that &apos;s the genome that takes the rest of the body .
in fact , in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death system is happening in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotions from george burns that in las vegas in las vegas show his show in the 1990s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
in front of him , it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i will take the soup . &quot;
i came to think of the realization as a doctor that i was doing a goal of how the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , only different .
i tried to keep the body out of it .
i wanted to keep a healthy one .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about restoration of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation to generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , you &apos;re looking at it , and i &apos;ve developed a <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to go to the ocean .
i think we would all know the mood , the woody allen to understand the woody allen , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life in the world .
it &apos;s not inevitable the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt the best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
in the reason of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and they &apos;re getting the hot steam , otherwise if fish were there , they would be cooked , they would have made a vacuum that they have made a <unk> environment for themselves .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a sense of balance .
and the reason for that is that it was first to get us through medicine , but they &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and from the population of the population .
and secondly , we as a species have to have our environment so <unk> that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to ourselves , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re moving and <unk> and mixing us so much that they can &apos;t say longer that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution .
one second possibility is that it will be an evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed from the forces of nature .
and the argument , here , here would be that the wheels of evolution slow down , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is going on as a species away from planets , and it will be isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and scary way .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that is not simply natural , but led and decided from us as a <unk> in the decisions that we do .
now how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do that ?
let &apos;s first look at reality that people today are making decisions today in some cultures .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choices to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so if you think about it , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but you &apos;re also making genetic adaptations that will heal disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change , to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or decrease the reduce of cancer or stroke it ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to be able to make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kind of changes will be more possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took a 13 years ago .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months ago .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome on a cost of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week ago .
it won &apos;t take more time until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection in itself , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with artists against influenza that have been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
this is all right today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so imagine two other little changes in the world .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if they could change sperm and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give their kids a better chance -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the <unk> of cancer , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want a healthier child ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine , is the same engine that can enable change to prevent disease to prevent disease , could enable us to adopt <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the <unk> <unk> of ken <unk> , especially if you &apos;re expanding it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why don &apos;t they have fast <unk> that will enable them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to adopt , we will adopt it from <unk> evolution to <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that is potentially 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years , and we can compress it to a thousand years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those grandchildren , or their grandchildren have to deal with it .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful that is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to be a society of <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to meet .
and in the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we will need to make these decisions ?
in the good way in evil , and early as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one , or another one that helps you to stand up and go up .
so at berkeley , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that they put in the morning and give them additional strength and increase their pace , and they will help them keep their balance .
that &apos;s actually the true <unk> of human and machine as well .
but not only that -- that together , and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
this is not just a crazy idea of that .
to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s allowed to take more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help to cope with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or your human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> i can carry 200 pounds on <unk> terrain , many hours .
his flexible design enables it to get deep in denial and <unk> and <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and get my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re at the same time to imagine this device , this new <unk> of this year in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take a look at the ted prize , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate of it .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord injury , which is in the height of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 40s -- and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population that multiplied up .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s a <unk> , or some complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been a 500 years since he had to say , i &apos;ve got to have a very successful introduction of it .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s carried by amanda <unk> , who had a <unk> , who had a <unk> , who has been doing it for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda , we &apos;re wearing our <unk> .
it has sensors .
its completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals , <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to their back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , which is <unk> , and the <unk> is in their hips as well as their <unk> , which they move forward into this pretty <unk> and very natural gear .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , i was <unk> to <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after the time , a doctor and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel of any <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been given me to learn , to go skiing again , climb up and go to the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to do to meet us and talk to them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential potential to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and for amanda , and all the leaders , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss the <unk> of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
when i &apos;m not <unk> the poverty of a volunteer , i <unk> the fire of a volunteer of the fire .
well , in our city , in the volunteers who supported a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early at the <unk> to be able to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire of fire .
i was the second volunteer of the <unk> , so i had a pretty good opportunity to get in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteer to reach the authorities <unk> and figure out what our problems would be .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the <unk> who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and they stood in <unk> and barefoot under a screen out of a screen outside the <unk> .
the other volunteer that just arrived before i was -- we call him <unk> luther -- first of all the time , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was struck by envy .
there was any lawyer or <unk> that was now for the rest of his life that people could tell people that he was in a <unk> house to save a living organism faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> me out of it .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
they have to go up and go up on fire , and get to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back at the front door , where i met my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our estimate outside to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his substantially got more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> came up with a letter to the <unk> in the brave <unk> of her house .
one thing about all measurements , kindness : someone had even been a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood , as well in my <unk> as a volunteer fireman , i witnessed generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see action of charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room , and you see people who can either have achieved a <unk> success or on their way there , i want to give you the point of memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until you &apos;ve achieved your first million .
if you give something to you , you &apos;re going to give it a lot of time .
use them in a <unk> , rooms for a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor of this .
not every day to save a chance to save the life of a human , but every day we give us the possibility to change one .
so they go on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the <unk> of humanity .
a place where women have the <unk> to say sex &quot; hello &apos; say , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your <unk> .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
as chimpanzees as chimps are led , fear is led to be led by <unk> female females .
they really came up with this , because this leads to a very severe society that has not been seen in fatal violence in fatal violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are at least known under the primates .
they live in the deep waters of the <unk> , and the observation is just difficult to look at .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the location of a violent debate that has been <unk> for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise the destruction of the bonobos to survive .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> , that you can &apos;t even fill a <unk> with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a little laugh that the trees shattered .
who are these relative ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; because they have <unk> , because they have <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , with <unk> partners and social <unk> .
i don &apos;t say that , that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of bonobos is more than the <unk> of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play for their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we &apos;re learning to trust and the rules of the game .
game enhances creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity in behaviors , diversity .
and when you see bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> , which is <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage right from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origins of , &quot; she puts him on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s rather , not true .
yeah .
so <unk> are spread , both in the bonobos , as well as people .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take many shapes , and it can take some kind of quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think exactly how they play sometimes , and we tend to be <unk> limits our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this kind of playful curiosity that makes us study , and interact , and the unexpected consequences that we form is the real ground of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos us to give us into our past and present .
but they also true a mystery to our future , a future where we have to adapt to the increased challenges , greater creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play .
but will we be doing the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
and for the bonobos and people and people , they don &apos;t have their lives from teeth and claws .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , play may be on the <unk> .
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together as we play creativity as we <unk> creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to introduce two pairs , middle 1979 , at exactly the same day , in exactly the same moment , every single <unk> -- okay .
so two couples , every baby <unk> , is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> because , if you think about the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
think of it just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case , this is a y station called a y <unk> that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , this is a <unk> chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the <unk> chromosome .
both of them are <unk> , both of the light .
we come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hats in the world .
under a hat , i did with the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people do with anatomy with anatomy -- meaning human body , the animal , the animal body -- how they thought about <unk> , with <unk> , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i wore on my work is the activist as a <unk> -- or , as i say , i say , as scary lawyer -- of people who are doctors of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> <unk> to ask the social norms .
so for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are bosnian twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller as usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who have not been the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes from many different shapes .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the kinds of <unk> guys that are not the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> , the <unk> gene , which we &apos;ve all got to have <unk> stadium .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are in the <unk> stage testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so there &apos;s a lot of testosterone , but it &apos;s not a reaction .
and as a result , the body evolved more of the typical female trajectory .
if the child gets born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
but it usually takes until they reached puberty , and grow their breasts and develop them , but they &apos;re not going to get their time until someone comes from this to something different .
and they &apos;re making a few tests and find out that they rather do rather than <unk> and uterus in reality , and that you have an y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for actually a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called <unk> in our bodies .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> places that are <unk> hormones , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i talk about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who was born with testicles and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> aren &apos;t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be spread across the range .
he had an extreme form of <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong , that they basically have a lot of sense of a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , its <unk> male , his brain , was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one knew something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he actually was inside the <unk> that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes and develop something that is called <unk> , with <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties of ways .
the reason the children with this kind of body -- be <unk> or <unk> , were <unk> -- of surgeons often committed to the norm , isn &apos;t because of the reason for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often made different kinds of surgical surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain amount of unique value with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman means to have a female identity , which means to be a black person , expect to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this awful <unk> idea of it .
and when we face with a body that is actually something very different , it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i had seen most excitement recently , the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender was asked by the <unk> world in berlin .
many journalists call me mit question , &quot; what are you going to do to do what you &apos;re going to do to say if <unk> is female female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists , that &apos;s not the test of that test .
now , what we know now is that gender is complicated enough , that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female or female and <unk> and female and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to say that the line of the line as natural .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our <unk> .
in our view , we have all sorts of <unk> areas of the world .
so , for example , we &apos;re going to run in the fact that 95 percent of our dna is common with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re only going to differ from a few <unk> of <unk> ?
while we continue to push our science further forward , we &apos;re increasingly going to get into a zone of <unk> , where we need to acknowledge that the <unk> categories that we &apos;ve probably had to be very simple .
we see this in all kinds of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see that we see in the <unk> culture in our culture today , in the united states today , is the struggle about the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point a body to people , so that he &apos;s a different right than fetal life .
we have a very difficult disagreement today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been as hard with the question when someone was dead .
they only kept a feather under the nose , and when she moved , they haven &apos;t buried it .
if they didn &apos;t move it , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we take people to take <unk> organs and put them in other people &apos;s other people .
and as a result , we caught up with the battle with the really difficult question when someone is dead . and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have so much more simple categories than earlier .
now you might think that all the <unk> of categories would really make me happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , and i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , it makes me tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i &apos;ve got to first pay that i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in what they did , i &apos;ve been able to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening to the <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> were in my view of the initial <unk> activists , so that &apos;s why .
what they were doing was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it by another that was radical and beautiful , and it was beautiful and 200 years for us .
as they all remember , our <unk> rejected the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the ancient world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to make these political power because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to son and so on .
the <unk> meadows that came back to this idea and send them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were created the same way .
they <unk> the field metaphor and decided that <unk> saw common attention , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they did that in part , because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things were together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the history of the <unk> , clear that many of you were interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations <unk> , and <unk> things , like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of power is based on a very <unk> of birthright .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they did a concept that was inherently common .
and so they &apos;re prepared for the future of the future movement .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years of that ?
and women are successful at success .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color , which are <unk> differences in anatomic areas , again , and even successful .
we see the same thing in <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start thinking about why we &apos;re saving certain <unk> .
well , mind mind , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
for example , i &apos;m not going to give a fish to the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be able to take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be the right to give their informed consent or to marry them .
so there are some anatomic problems that make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking about .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been <unk> in the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 2010 , in the exact same day of 1979 .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , was born three months of <unk> , so she was born on june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born to <unk> , so he was born on one march in march .
only because of the fact that maria was born three months of <unk> , they have all sorts of right three months before heinrich -- the right <unk> to have sex to choose the right thing .
heinrich needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , only because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find other kinds of <unk> on what their rights is .
heinrich , because you think he &apos;s a male male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s a male male , he can now be moved on , which is now <unk> .
so maria in all states can do the same thing in all states that heinrich in all states has been able to do and marry it right .
heinrich can marry a woman , but maria can marry a woman , but maria can marry a woman today .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are problematic and questionable .
and for me , what is the question : what will we do , because our science is going to make progress in the realm of the anatomy that we have to admit , that a democracy that is based on anatomy , could be <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is going to be naked .
so where do we go from that ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture of posture , &quot; well , we have to pull somewhere a line , so we move it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , texas at a point , has decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome and marry a woman to marry a y chromosome .
now people are not tested for their chromosomes in practice .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i used to tell you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the <unk> of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of talking , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t do people for &quot; their skin , &quot; but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are you looking at people because of their <unk> ?
i want to suggest that i &apos;m probably going to know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some <unk> that i know .
so how should we <unk> the question of the character of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard to do it .
and part of me wonder , what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be done in the future that would be done in the future -- using fmri ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make sense of democracy .
in our effort to democracy , we &apos;ve done this thing very well , and i think we would make our point in the future .
and the conditions are not going to exist on us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago who had <unk> twins , to separate them , partly to make a name .
and i said , &quot; well , do you consider political asylum rather than one operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be that they are , without having to change the state of the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look , or saw , if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that a feminist bit is radical , and that i think there might be different kinds of insights , which are driven by different kinds of anatomy , which is <unk> by different kinds of anatomy .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in research .
and one of the things i found really interesting about is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think about and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average -- not everybody , but in average -- rather , more complex social relationships and the care for people that are vulnerable to the group , to give very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i did a graduate student , i asked myself one of my colleagues who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as an feminist question , so that &apos;s a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i ever heard about .
feminism is about stereotypes about gender , that &apos;s why feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so more , i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
that should say it could be a little bit , in average , which is a female brains of human beings , and what &apos;s different about us to worry about <unk> social relationships , and <unk> , for example , to worry about that .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go into the future when we have democracy about anatomy -- less than thinking about the individual body , thinking about the individual body , and think more about relationships .
so , when we try to create a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find a different opportunity to find a different kind of <unk> , <unk> outfit , and to photograph and blog it recently .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people , my dollar for usually a good purpose ; i look quite unique ; i look quite unique ; and it makes it a lot of personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
is it going to have my size ?
will i like to be the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if everybody answers , i feel like i won &apos;t have won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;m doing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what do someone bring with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly exactly what i brought in .
i brought seven couple of <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly a week is everything i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet i had anything else i wanted to wear , if i came to palm springs .
and because they haven &apos;t heard from me as the woman who &apos;s going to walk here at ted in her underwear -- that i found a couple of things .
and i want to show you what i want to show you for this week .
sounds that good ?
while i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i think you don &apos;t believe or not , and didn &apos;t learn from these online problems .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , got 55 cost , and it was the most expensive piece that i wore in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will be totally overrated .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time on my life to try to be , and adapt me at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i saw as if i got dressed . &quot;
i like to smile , and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key thing .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for you .
if you think you &apos;re inside and the outside is a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fits with everything .
and ultimately , saturday : one of the unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without telling a word .
it was always been proved to me and over again when people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it won &apos;t fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all over again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotional , because in the corner of the corner , it &apos;s always a different kind of crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait for me when i love a little bit in heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , called flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
for some time , when they wanted to win a formula , they took their budget , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
this would call them in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> portion and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the <unk> is starting to appear in our lives .
our cities have been <unk> in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they become the computer in free .
and as computers in free , they start to react to other ways , and driven them and powered .
if we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something to the cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense , and driving in objects of daily life .
this is from an exhibition that &apos;s created paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have out of our environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo &apos;s ...
well , today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m going to show you just some examples -- again , with the idea of perceiving our environment , to be aware of our environment .
let &apos;s start with the point of view .
now the first project i want to show you is in truth of one of the first our labs .
it was a four years ago in italy .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the <unk> place .
some of you will remember , it was when italy played against france , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy won at the end of it .
now you see what happened on this day , just at the watch of activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city of the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , in front of the game .
they &apos;re looking at the timeline of time .
early afternoon , people here and there , the calls made and move .
the game starts to start -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy is a gateway to the door .
<unk> , people do a short call , go on the toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal <unk> .
first amount , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> , <unk> .
italy wins , yeah .
now , in this night , they all went to celebrate it .
they were looking at the big issue .
the next day , everybody went into the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all the time went down .
you see the picture of the space called <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , people go to celebration -- to have a great party , and they see the matters at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way , as we couldn &apos;t do .
again , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well , today , we know all about how our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that have a mac computer where they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where things are going on .
so , in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we started with a little more than a year ago in seattle to tag the things that they &apos;re looking at -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the little brands that tie him to garbage and start tracking him .
so here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got to get in .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day that we see every day that the cup we throw out , they &apos;re not just going to disappear somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re going to throw on every day .
and if we were to show that people , then we can make change change .
so this is the reason for this project .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> , which came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition in public places to use water as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that was going on with a <unk> <unk> was , you know , put out these tubes and valves , valves , <unk> , valves that open up and close .
it &apos;s what you &apos;re doing with a <unk> of water , which is a <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall down , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , images , text .
and you can step out of it , and it will open up to be able to let you see how you can see this image .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it &apos;s been very <unk> .
and we got the assignment to design a building on the expo .
we called it the digital water system .
the whole building was out of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you &apos;re approaching it , it will open and let it inside .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even cut the roof down .
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
so here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who says what &apos;s happening in inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test sensors that opened the water to open water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but in this night , it was a more more fun one .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was completely different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that still had to break down and have holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that will be used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections of it .
and this is what it brought to us to think about this project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that you could really start flying out of these <unk> .
imagine you could have little helicopter that flies through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , in perfect synchrony .
you can have the cloud of that .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or posters but in three dimensions that change what &apos;s happening , the light is not the position of <unk> .
they can play with different kinds of things .
imagine the screen just could appear in different <unk> or scales , in different ways , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud of <unk> , where they can move around and move through and move them through many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , which is <unk> to shape like a <unk> v .
if you turn to light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people &apos;s being controlled .
it could have a impulse that has a impulse that comes from people , from the movement of people or something .
i want to show you a little bit of the time here .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we took his movements into 3d to use them as a impulse to use .
here you can see <unk> dancing .
on the left side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> , at the same time , and a <unk> .
so you can understand the whole thing of that .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all kinds of <unk> , they can play with it and play with color motion and play <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible pulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics for the olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud , the cloud , the cloud .
and the idea is , again , you know , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people in order to do something and change the environment -- almost as something we call it <unk> <unk> how to move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little <unk> for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable one of the things that happened last years , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
that has digitized everything , and it &apos;s going to be accessible to the internet .
today , we can first -- and the campaign obama showed this -- and the campaign obama showed -- can change the digital world of networks in the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city of the city .
but tomorrow can be to ask us to ask the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical physical .
so the idea is that we actually have the people involved in which they are doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud of <unk> , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical fabric in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more pervasive , and it &apos;s using a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go on , like london new <unk> .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital <unk> <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , my context is very important .
by my work i &apos;m trying to express that , that people aren &apos;t separated from nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
<unk> me .
my heart went to me , and i was trying to get to grab what i was looking at .
the <unk> around me <unk> nearly 60 feet out of the water , and i was just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year after year .
<unk> is born as a calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with the obvious way to interact with their surroundings and their experiences .
some barriers contain to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t withstand more passion in a <unk> .
if you look at a iceberg , you think you &apos;re slightly isolated , separated and alone , just as we see people often .
but the truth is far away from that .
while it melts a iceberg , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
and it melts during the iceberg , he <unk> <unk> drinking drinking water .
i &apos;m going to take portraits of this <unk> as i would do portraits of my ancestors in the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments , and never again .
it &apos;s not death when it melts ; it &apos;s not the end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i want to show you , show a iceberg that i have in greenland in greenland in greenland .
very rarely will you see a <unk> iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please pay attention to the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is happening in real time .
and just like this , the iceberg is a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on is this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then , one day he came back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it as well .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can just use his eyes .
i stood up with him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the world art and look at .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him and asked me , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you heard about higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly and <unk> , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s how you communicate -- so your fingers are running along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very <unk> , how can this be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead i asked a check from that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was supposed to <unk> him .
because it &apos;s an farce that someone who is still wearing this is not in itself . &quot;
so i spoke to a conference for a few months later .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface and then draw a light on each other , which is just the negative area to draw .
so they &apos;re moving around and they &apos;re making <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are shown there are a life cycle of life .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , after then , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots of years ago , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we &apos;ve got the insurance insurance <unk> the doors , and actually , in fact , they get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that &apos;s incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also have seven programmers out of the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do that , and that we were <unk> and all images on the walls would be <unk> .
but for over two weeks we &apos;re programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description of that .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the house and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , and we put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that is free to be accessible -- you can build it into a device that is free , we can build the code for free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
not a hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate alone with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of someone else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this <unk> in front of the big unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony drew the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we tended to have his bed , so he can see it outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the <unk> in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
we also had to deal with the parking lot , so we had to deal with this as a part of the <unk> .
at the end of the end , he sent us an email with the following content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i was drawn to something .
i feel that i went to the water , and i finally pushed someone down to the bottom and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> <unk> .
it keeps us holding up , and it keeps us going on .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes from a <unk> .
and someone who has such a <unk> potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re going to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition on this .
we won a few prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , was honored to us than one of the 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that there &apos;s this april , in fact , at <unk> <unk> in downtown los angeles to give a show called &quot; sort of <unk> . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the toughest representative of the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty unpredictable .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i didn &apos;t have anything to do with <unk> , but i just captured something , and i was surrounded with amazing people so that we could put something together .
and that question should give you any of them , and that &apos;s where every single day that &apos;s going to be done , which needs to be done , if not now , when you do , if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t , and then if you &apos;re , you know who ?
thank you very much .
so , i write for children , and i probably have america &apos;s most commonly <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want a scientist to come in .
you can have a farmer as a farmer or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you have left it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as revelation .
this is a picture of a circle of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was beaten up every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the <unk> .
so they did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me for san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it important in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher , <unk> , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see you .
i &apos;m unhappy that we never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that they &apos;ve found him .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to know . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took us to her , and we gave them eight , because it was needed .
it was something that we knew about .
and just as the woman wanted me to learn me as adults , they turned into a box in a box and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of which i talked about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything to have the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
it needs to -- it would take , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big blast while you climb up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine already <unk> , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see in manhattan .
two minutes later , three things later happened .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
it <unk> the rockets .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard of .
he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror that &apos;s been <unk> .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , it &apos;s all different .
as i thought about it later , i realized a phrase that says , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to move into life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we went to the george washington bridge , so pretty much <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better to become better in everything that i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego to my ego .
and i <unk> the time i <unk> things to <unk> things with people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have a <unk> with my wife &apos;s sake .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right thing ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the inner clock <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water that &apos;s going on .
i said , &quot; please <unk> the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to be in 20 parts of the way you know it from clips .
while we cut , i had this feeling , man , to die , is not terrifying .
almost like that , we would be preparing for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really <unk> in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
about a month after a month , i visited a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent .
there &apos;s no time .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , it made a sense of me .
now , i realized that by the time i connected the dots to each other , it &apos;s just about being a great father in life .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i was the miracle of dying in this day not dying .
i received another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to everybody who flies today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine that , and how would you change ?
what would they do to do that , because they think they &apos;d be there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here are <unk> .
now , if you &apos;re able to do it now , the systems that control systems and valves control and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning of <unk> .
so we &apos;re going to start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will <unk> into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the iranian <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s a little bit of easy , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research back six months ago , six months ago , it was totally unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most important part of the <unk> , the most popular part , it made by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed something <unk> , with these gray boxes , with these gray boxes .
and we started with the attention of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we were infected our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something odd happened .
it was a little bit like a <unk> <unk> that our cheese didn &apos;t like -- <unk> <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after all , after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to see that this is a <unk> attack .
on a particular goal , the same thing .
the <unk> <unk> active active on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered , even when the special ingredient was discovered , which is trying to get it on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , then don &apos;t do anything about it .
so , that was really my interest , and we started working with it almost almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , say , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is to be able to do that .
so <unk> and <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code and found it in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who obviously had all kinds of <unk> information .
they knew all bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
you probably probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew all the time .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech , let me tell you , let me tell you , the <unk> is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than everything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code of code .
we &apos;re talking about this -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we &apos;re able to be able to be smart .
so after first , what we were looking for was <unk> <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and trying to connect this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these targets that we could prove or <unk> .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves , that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , and it has to act around a <unk> goal , very likely to be in iran because there were most infections .
well , there &apos;s not several thousand goals in this area .
and basically , it goes out to the <unk> nuclear power plant , and on the <unk> of <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me give you a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and i <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise what we had in code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> to the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this <unk> , then you actually have to be able to crack the rotor down , and eventually even <unk> the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve been finding is that the goal of the attack was actually slow to get it slowly -- obviously , to try to give <unk> despair , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get into it .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse by looking at very carefully data and <unk> .
so for example , the number of <unk> units are very noisy from this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started talking about scientific literature , about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found out that they &apos;re <unk> in the so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> .
so this made sense of it , which is fit together .
and it &apos;s got better than that .
these <unk> in iran are divided up in 15 times a little bit .
and guess what we found in the business of <unk> .
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that fit together .
and this gave us great confidence for the one that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not just that way .
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work .
and we just ran out of a dead , and we had to collect ourselves .
in fact , we found that both digital warheads are actually in fact in one and the same goal , but from different directions .
and the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and they <unk> the rotors and they slowed down the rotors and slow them up with six <unk> in interaction and reproduction .
so , in large , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have basically determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be met by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff we discovered -- really <unk> me out of my socks .
down there is the gray box , and on top of it , you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is , is that it &apos;s <unk> values from sensors -- so for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s available , and it &apos;s available code , which is still during attack , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> code .
and in fact , these wrong forces are actually taken data from <unk> .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> are fed up with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just the case of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
it &apos;s actually much dangerous and more dangerous .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> of it .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , in a power station , for example , if the large <unk> is too fast , you have to open <unk> in milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and when they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the <unk> , the <unk> , will notice it .
that &apos;s frightening .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put it on a <unk> stick , as we saw it at <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology in the spread of it .
you have to spread it only as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
so that &apos;s the consequence that we need to do .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we need to be able to do the consequences , and we get better to prepare for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been told very much that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> of it .
is that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is to be involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- luckily , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even greater .
thank you for having a <unk> <unk> . thank you , ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years to place me in situations that are normally very difficult and much more dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
so when i knew i would come here to look here in a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i put an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent out a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the possibility to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk 2011 .
but then it &apos;s a very good media , it &apos;s a very good one of them .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of them .
this is just the <unk> , by the way .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
now , if you asked me this year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going to go out in a pretty horrible situation over the years , but nothing could be prepared me , not allowed me to do anything so hard to go to anything as hard as these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is make a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from top down to the bottom , is completely <unk> by the end of the <unk> -- from the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center of ...
these people will be connected to the film in infinity -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more <unk> .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x than <unk> , but we &apos;re sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe they ever wore .
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever driven , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing you that brands are a part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie that &apos;s called <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy when <unk> would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a perspective because that has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop that ?
how much money is needed to realize ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth giving , and i think it &apos;s worth some really famous brands .
who knows when the film comes out , maybe we might see a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think you &apos;re going to be like ?
the answer is probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both right .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do it with ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
think of the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to take a <unk> .
it turns out it &apos;s actually meant , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product so many people as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media and the <unk> media , it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting way that the masses is bringing this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
actually , no , that was not the mistake of that .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that &apos;s okay .
but what this picture is , it &apos;s a problem .
you see , if you look at transparency at the <unk> point , this is -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to detect and <unk> ; <unk> by <unk> and access to information , especially what <unk> <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole amount of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president tells it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to the fact that it &apos;s done , it changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s very risky .
what else is the risk of that ?
a whole shell of cool food is <unk> .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there and looking at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in every history of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version of it .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , the idea is a profound problem .
i have friends who do big , giant <unk> <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> of how i do .
and my friends who are big , huge <unk> <unk> , say that the reason their films are so successful is so successful on the <unk> .
and then my friends say that little <unk> , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to ban <unk> in the film ?
always , if i do go on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i <unk> someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you there ? you see a little nervous of it .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should have a little bit of the interview in the interview . &quot;
and then we provide one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> both for men as well as women -- <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all their questions and give you a <unk> socket .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so making things like this -- you know , remember people in ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
with what words would they describe to ban them ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes to something positive , compared to &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , more <unk> <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like love clothes .
&apos; 80s , <unk> <unk> meets <unk> , except on the <unk> .
all right , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like sunglasses , or a jewelry , and this stuff .
if dan was a brand , he probably would be a classic mercedes <unk> .
man two : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : part of course , part of <unk> , part of part <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> <unk> across the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what was noticed was that i needed to have a experts .
i needed someone who could penetrate my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to detect these <unk> .
if you could do it for that , you could also help me .
they brought her pictures , yes ?
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how to relate to their thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world you live in -- like people around one , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and i start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s kind of like how i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like , odd things like that .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it get us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you in now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what does the red look like ?
tell me a little bit about this part of it .
a little bit more about them , that &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing .
what else do they have to go through ?
... that &apos;s not a fear of being afraid . in what kind of rollercoaster are they going to be like , right ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well , good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
there was a lot of crazy things about it .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> <unk> two separate , but it has <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> <unk> brand .
they &apos;re very good at that .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction in it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
what other brands are doing of that ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii small , mini <unk> and <unk> .
now , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things coming and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if anybody would ask them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would you ?
you have a <unk> ? are you something that is driving blood in <unk> ?
or are they more likely to be <unk> ?
are you something that is a little calm , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh as the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , failed , <unk> , <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , magical , <unk> , <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> in the world .
are they mindful and <unk> like <unk> <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and <unk> and said no , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using today , that you &apos;re using <unk> to do the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertising as well .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the city of the city for five years , no <unk> , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we drove in school school , in school school , in the <unk> community in impoverished schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i had was most feedback with or where i had the biggest success , those are where i was directly related to things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , which is people thinking that our view is changing .
and how did they do that for them ? what it was ?
now , because the film was opening on the <unk> film festival , we can look at it .
according to <unk> , it was opening up in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
this is actually just one of two weeks from two weeks ago .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been <unk> .
there &apos;s no one yet online . no <unk> .
it hasn &apos;t come out of other countries .
well , the film has come up with a very large device .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , at almost every <unk> that we talked about , which we &apos;ve recommended to leave their clients .
something i firmly think about is that if you take your opportunity to capture risks , you &apos;re taking risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid risks , you &apos;re willing to avoid the whole company , you know , to acquire a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be <unk> .
finally , we should welcome the fear of being welcome .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome your risk .
there &apos;s a big taste of a big taste , so we &apos;re going to welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they welcome transparency to the <unk> , &quot; you &apos;re looking at my good friends from <unk> , <unk> for ebay .
big data will transform for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> presents &quot; don welcome to transparency
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this is : what &apos;s going on right with the $ 1 ?
that &apos;s a great question to do .
i have a check in my pocket , in front of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in the altitude of dollars <unk> to fund my <unk> next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i made something different at google , and i went to <unk> something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is today , gave me green light .
and it took me 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and to explain access to this slide .
i grew up in india .
i was having a great education -- i didn &apos;t make me -- but i had a lot of museums , but i had no <unk> and this artwork .
when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot to learn .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- art accessible -- to make technology together .
and then we started a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to go to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums in these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i actually come into one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re walking around and correct .
you want to be <unk> in the museum ?
open the card , and you jump with a click .
in it , they want them to go to the end of the gangs .
just on . a lot of fun .
look for it .
thank you , but the best one is happening .
so , i &apos;m in front of one of my <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click it now .
this is one of the images we captured with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this image has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to do for 10 billion ? &quot;
so this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can very easily <unk> and <unk> .
you see a funny thing here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they want to really go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close close to , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit , talking with some familiar at the met , and actually found out that it was a game called <unk> , who is beaten up with a <unk> with a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close , you can go to the <unk> .
just to give you a <unk> , i &apos;m going to see you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
at the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> in the world ?
and what if you want to see van gogh like van gogh being able to create this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re in there . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorites of this picture until i really am at the <unk> .
this is <unk> , never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function of it .
there &apos;s many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
and this is the really cool part of it , which is called collections .
each of you , everyone -- just whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection of it .
very simple , they go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all with comments , send your friends , and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
and i think , finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from here .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums to come out of the museums .
i might not say that , you know ?
they come from artists .
and that was a experience in humility to me .
i mean , i &apos;m hoping that we &apos;re going to be present with this digital medium of art , and they represent beautifully online .
and it &apos;s the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked for me , &quot; have you done that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it should give you the experience of that .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a view of your brain . your brain can be <unk> in two camps .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , this is someone who is completely useful .
that would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive to be in the world .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , their brain looks something like this -- with a high school system that &apos;s in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
they can be intuitive and intuitive .
and so i look as one of the people , together with most other experimental <unk> , who need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good proportion of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and look at how it responds , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they &apos;re basically doing the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over years is probably that one thing can only be a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be strange to think about that , that one thing at the same time is the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they evolved .
i remember looking at a child playing on a <unk> .
he was a toddler and not very good at that , and he fell down .
but i bet that he taught him a very valuable lesson with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is the great thing that you can &apos;t just get over and stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a horrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re unaware of all kinds of odd things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be in the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed to describe quantum mechanics to the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe it to the great mundane objects of us .
this didn &apos;t really like my intuition , and maybe just because i &apos;m not doing it as often with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side , it hasn &apos;t really liked it .
because if all things are made of particles , all these particles are following the rules of quantum mechanics , not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should be that way .
so i would be able to feel better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that , if we could somehow show that <unk> , the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do this .
i created one of them .
this is the first object you can see , which was <unk> in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip that we see .
and you can see the green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;m expanding on here . we &apos;re looking at it right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal that &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it stands across the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours in all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to do this as a <unk> pool of hole and getting the thing .
this thing has been the ability to be able to be <unk> in the <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look at , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , but then other people and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to make it wrong , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics is that <unk> objects feel the same way .
the <unk> of <unk> objects aren &apos;t just people , but the light that seems to be on it and the wind that seems to you about them and the heat of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal , this piece of metal acts , we had to get out of the entire <unk> .
so that &apos;s what we did .
we took the light off , put it into a vacuum and put it into a vacuum and <unk> it up until almost right now , just in the elevator , was the piece of metal free to behave as it wanted to behave .
so we measured the movement of it .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
instead of just sitting there , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s the way it was <unk> , like this , like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vibrate it up at the same time and simulate it not to vibrate in the same time -- something that allows only in quantum mechanics .
so what i just tell you about is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms in the world .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms out of those pieces are silent there , and at the same time , same atoms move down and down .
it &apos;s just true of accurate <unk> , which is true .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
yeah .
it was worth me for all this year in clean space , because , check that that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece is sort of like the difference between the piece of metal and the metal .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal can be , in two different places , why don &apos;t they even be ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says about .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness realize that your body is <unk> in the room .
there &apos;s another aspect in the history of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like as if all the objects in the elevator are actually just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how mechanics says everything is all connected .
now , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more right than it is , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their ties with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and curious of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to <unk> how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they want life and work , they have given them the possibility between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new residents .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who are not even a single city in the developing world that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much worth more value than it costs them .
so what we could do is very simple with the world &apos;s <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities in the world .
now this may sound absurd now for you , unless you think about new cities .
but they just share the building of apartments against cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , did not do that .
you could try to extend the capacity to extend existing apartments .
but , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re the laws of stress in these apartments and their environment .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to keep all these increments of these profiles .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new block of block , the laws there would be able to support a new block of building , and not <unk> it .
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i discovered that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> have thought about the challenge of reforms .
in 2009 , in the summer of 2009 , under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , he won &apos;t win <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program was both new , as well as <unk> .
he asked <unk> to become a <unk> of <unk> .
in the meantime , i applied to a talk to tedglobal .
and through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city in the <unk> city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws , laws , which determine that you &apos;re not allowed to cover existing <unk> .
we pay big attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and they &apos;re usually the laws that kept us back .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link of guatemala to the link to the tedtalk .
and again , he showed him <unk> .
both of the ones called me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami with a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used to use this graph to show how valuable <unk> is at a place like new york . think about that , that there &apos;s thousands of dollars per square meter worth of dollars .
but it was a rather abstract discussion in a place when there was a pause , when there was a pause , <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> who said that we need to make this project that is important , and that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s the way our country is going to move forward .
i was asked to come back to <unk> and give a talk to the fourth and fifth january .
so , i &apos;ve given another thing with facts , which has given a graph like this , which contains a graph like this , that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city denver , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in denver .
even this airport alone has a place of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince you , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand years old .
polite <unk> have been <unk> .
the audience in the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city gives us new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in <unk> , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
we &apos;re in an area of it .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand square miles .
and shortly after , in january 19th , january , they &apos;ve voted for congress to have a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a violent crisis behind , congress was chosen to vote with a voice of <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it needs to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , it became approved for the second time with <unk> to a voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and february , there &apos;s a delegation of about 30 <unk> of the world who was most interested in the world that was most interested in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new center that built in south korea , built in south korea , large than the urban <unk> .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years , after it took four years to get the permits to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there were two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so , if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s the where we stand today .
they already have a <unk> , and they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already going to work on a legal system that <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also going to work on a external legal system .
a country has already been offered to provide his supreme court as a dish for the <unk> system .
and <unk> and <unk> are very interested in it .
they even get funding with it .
one thing , as you already know , have been seen , there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
there are many companies who like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
throughout the world , there are 700 million people who tell them that they want to live on a different place in a different place .
a million people deserted every year and migrate into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to <unk> their families to <unk> their families , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to earn enough money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to find their parents that they &apos;ve never seen , in some cases , since a decade ago .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about it in order to build a completely new city of life ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of the world &apos;s spread , or hundreds of the world &apos;s <unk> ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
i asked my friends from <unk> to say , thank ted .
do you know how many decisions you do for a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical american <unk> is a typical american one on a day .
and also , recently , a study of ceos made a study where they saw a week for the ceos .
and these scientists just documented the different themes that these ceo are concerned with , and how much time they engage with making decisions that relate to the topics .
and they found that an average ceo &apos;s busy doing <unk> tasks in the week .
each of these topics was of course , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you have in the nine minutes of category in the nine minutes of the meeting ?
how good do you think you &apos;re going to do to solve your decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest sources of our modern time , which is <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you willing to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a ph.d. student at stanford university , i went to this very very <unk> store ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a shop that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of vegetables and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had <unk> .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how do you never get a little <unk> ?
here &apos;s the olive oil in the world .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so one day i decided to go visit one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; work that model that you really want to offer all these choices ? &quot;
and he showed on the <unk> of tourists that came out every day and usually their cameras .
we decided to ask an experiment , and we chose <unk> to our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gear .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> on the entrance to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve put six different tastes out there , or put 24 different tastes <unk> , and we &apos;ve put two things out there : first , i think , what would people be standing for more people , and they &apos;re trying to try and try and get <unk> ?
there are more people standing there when it was 24 , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what &apos;s going on in what people would buy a glass of paper .
now , we saw the opposite effect .
the people who stayed there when it was 24 , they were actually buying three percent , actually , in a glass of <unk> .
the people who stayed there when they were six , well , now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you &apos;re doing it , people bought six times a glass of <unk> , who you had six times when you had six to a selection .
now , not to buy a jar of glass <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that it &apos;s good for our hip , but it turns out that it &apos;s <unk> us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it comes against our own best interests .
so the day of the day is to save resources .
now , i &apos;m going to describe a study now that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which we were doing in order to retire for almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of people who were able to have a <unk> can be able to get a <unk> , the <unk> plan , the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found out that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more the fund was offered that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme view , the plans that offered two fund , they had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
so in the plans that almost 60 fund offered , the <unk> now fell on about the <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you were to participate in <unk> , if there were more possibilities for choice , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who have chosen people who decided to be involved in the more ways that the more choices are to be able to pick up it and fund it .
the more ways they were available to them , the more they put their entire money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , you know , are listening to people who recommend people who are important to the future of well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key negative consequences that have been given to people who provide more and more choices .
it &apos;s getting the decision -- push it up , even when it &apos;s going to be the best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to meet worse decisions -- worse health and worse medical choices .
they &apos;re going to decide about things that they make themselves less satisfied , even if they make objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may be enjoying this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but in fact , we can &apos;t look at the comparison and can be able to pick up the comparison and choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different ways and in various ways -- they can just use them in their business .
first of all , focus .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that is less .
people are always worried , if i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they always worry they &apos;re losing <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different head of head , and <unk> species of 26 to 15 times , they &apos;ve experienced a cost of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 at the worst sold <unk> , they experienced that the returns to 87 percent -- a result of both of both , the increase of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , for them , offers 45,000 products .
it &apos;s a typical walmart of a typical of you today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which today &apos;s <unk> supermarket is <unk> , and they &apos;re just offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce -- a kind of tomato sauce .
every single harvard employees now takes up on a <unk> part of the time .
those who really want to meet a selection will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to take it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i want to ask you is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other are different .
and if their employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said he &apos;d be willing to offer everyone in this audience to give a <unk> vacation to the most beautiful street on the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read to you a little bit .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i urge you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to adopt gary &apos;s hand .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to adopt gary &apos;s hand .
is that all the time ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more about that .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you look at objective information , the first time , but the second time , but i would be able to imagine the car that they thought it was in the second time .
because the images made it real for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps them deal with the problem of climate change is the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between options , to understand what consequences with individuals are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences have to feel vivid and concrete .
why are people spending more than 30 percent more than 30 percent of the time if they use a credit card or a credit card , as in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel we &apos;re going to feel money .
and it turns out that if you can make it concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting just as it was always , we just added a little bit more .
the little thing that we have to do is we &apos;ve asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives when they were going to save money .
third technology : <unk> <unk> .
we can deal with more categories than more choices than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a <unk> .
it turns out it &apos;s in the <unk> supermarkets , and below the northeast area , the number between <unk> different types of magazines to <unk> magazines has been <unk> .
but you know what ?
because the categories tell me how to hold them apart .
here &apos;s two different types of dna .
one is called jazz , and the other one is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left ad is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap into hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the left is jazz , and the one , on the right side , is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
and the categories have to say to the <unk> thing , not that silk is available .
and this problem , you often see , if you look at the long lists , you see the long one .
who &apos;s actually going to inform them ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to be simplify them .
we need to get rid of complexity .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely completely .
now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
<unk> , <unk> the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , <unk> -- four possibilities .
so what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half of the customers go from many ways , 56 <unk> <unk> to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers are coming from the low possibilities , four gears to 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how are they interested in that .
if they use all the time in the decision , that means that they will be overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who are going to go from many to the small <unk> are always going to go and choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the one , then you stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is going to be present .
when i start with the simple one , i &apos;m learning how to <unk> .
even though the gears choose to choose , nothing about my preferences in the interior says , it &apos;s still going to pick me up .
it also <unk> me in excitement about the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to be willing to be involved .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of <unk> <unk> -- just -- will give you the <unk> alternatives -- <unk> -- make it real ; organize -- we can do better with more categories , less possibilities .
every one of these techniques that i &apos;m telling you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for people to service .
because i think the key thing to be the best choice is that you can pick up with choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , and i &apos;m a <unk> at youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- running , singers , comedians -- when i was young , that &apos;s so infinitely difficult .
but <unk> has allowed us to have all our creative activities , or all our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous for the internet to next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video , more than 48 hours of video .
again , there &apos;s only a tiny percentage of it ever <unk> and will look at thousands of times , and it &apos;s like the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , then we want to do it .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> .
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> showed this video that was filmed in front of his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was popular for the first summer .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share with a rainbow .
because you &apos;re going to do that as you call high mountain <unk> .
he had uploaded every amount of rice .
and this video was actually being sent in january of january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> coming out .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> presents us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
rebecca <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looking at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , it &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it started , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. of <unk> science theater was a first one who made a joke with twitter .
it &apos;s important that a person or a group of <unk> would take a point of view with a great audience with a great audience and sped up the process .
then these community formed the community of people who shared these large <unk> , and started talking about it .
there &apos;s now 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days there was a parody for every single <unk> .
unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community &apos;s community will be part of this phenomenon -- either by us and making something new from it .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it turned out to be almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it up for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that was looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video as well .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
important , the creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
they were <unk> .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot from the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something , we &apos;re doing it .
who would have all predicted this to be <unk> .
who would have &quot; double <unk> &quot; or rebecca <unk> , &quot; <unk> black or <unk> <unk> ?
what <unk> did you have to write from your writing , which is that <unk> ?
in a world where every minute , every minute is uploaded to two days , only unique and unexpected <unk> might be like the video .
i admit i wasn &apos;t interested in a friend of mine when i said a friend , i should look at this great video of a guy who protested in new york against parking feet .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not going to be on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s disabilities that don &apos;t make a <unk> on the <unk> .
since that was completely surprising and humorous , casey <unk> became funny , and his argument looked at five million times .
this approach applies to everything that we do creative .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new type of media and culture that everybody has access to and in the audience of the audience .
as i said , one of the largest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning to youtube .
nobody needs to give their ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as the owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not making them even on the media today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still composed of it .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece of -- a man who burns his life is burning .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom was held in his home .
think of it as the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> eyes in front of the way he told himself that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , are <unk> .
he pulled himself back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to <unk> us , but it &apos;s gone .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> is quiet at lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life was asked to be a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was totally <unk> that they could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat still <unk> a boat on the lake .
and all the adults were aware of the risks .
it was the biggest fear of pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little bit of <unk> .
when i was a <unk> , my sister and i drink it , and then they drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- all the way to <unk> the motors , the clapping of any wave on the bug , the big and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that i didn &apos;t have to get out of the pirates , but to get out of the <unk> of men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the motors that didn &apos;t want to start .
no apple ever tasted it again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations making together a new life .
we let us down in <unk> , one from the working-class <unk> , which is the population of <unk> <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell of <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> had been exchange between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line of <unk> , six days , six layers ago .
it sort of made her time to find english and <unk> in english .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given and put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do , mostly the new things that always came from the second hand .
two few <unk> for school , everyone to cover the holes in the other way .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because it had to be six years tall .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; asian , go home .
after home ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and they heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake until their <unk> came up , so i could wake them up .
she opened a <unk> , then made a <unk> , and he opened a store .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looking for it .
centers in the world .
i lived in <unk> .
in one one i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of themselves .
in the other hand , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence wearing violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but that &apos;s how many of the years come from .
and because of this help i was chosen in my last year , i was chosen to have a young <unk> of the year .
and i became <unk> from a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> <unk> , was now tan tan tan tan , <unk> tan , in places that you &apos;ve never heard of , and in homes , you &apos;ve never been able to imagine .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the <unk> of the world .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
it reminded me that i was now as old as we climbed the boat .
no one has never been a possibility of it .
&quot; make it easy , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the open i talked about , the more i should tell them about that .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , they lived on the borders of possible .
and even though i graduated from my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself a career .
there had to be a different <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a <unk> , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead so easily to collapse in the forest , so easily that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i went to know enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world &apos;s world , but not as you &apos;re <unk> .
possibilities that were not allowed to be embarrassing .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange feature of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed a little bit of my gut .
i collected a little team of people around me for the <unk> , which was not a <unk> challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a dime from a year .
at the end of one of each tags , i cook a huge amount of soup that we shared with .
we were working late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a few brilliant of them , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to draw in the u.s .
after just a journey there &apos;s a journey .
my gut , again .
three months later i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the social norm was the most important person in taiwan .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after their birth .
her mother <unk> her up .
with 17 , she became beaten up with the mother &apos;s second woman , her mother &apos;s mother .
without support her husband , she was worried about her husband using him and <unk> in her own case , and a more bigger <unk> than she won .
&quot; not , &quot; turned out to be <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she was coming to say that she was going to say that .
my mother called me a few minutes ago .
a few days later , we went in a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in her coffin .
we told their stories and <unk> their stories that we were still with .
at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been tomorrow for today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t <unk> them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
if you look at who we were and how life has shaped , we can see the men who might have come into our lives that would have come into our lives .
the defeat was too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m thinking about the boat .
who would ever wish one of them ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous of all wave , the <unk> , the <unk> of the motors , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee any ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to you , and you could safely do it , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is there photography at all the time ?
because this is , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , was the age of 15 years old .
i combined it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because it was the camera using the camera in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography appeared to be more about being at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the process is going to go .
photographs like this : a construction site on a lot of <unk> street .
but it &apos;s got an unexpected <unk> .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic plane .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> simultaneously , but all with the common goal to keep a realistic plane .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i &apos;d like to look at it as if they could have that , in a photograph .
pictures that you need to think about a brief moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it around the details or the colors of the color ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the illusion is an illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces of pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of it .
we &apos;ve got three perfect objects here , and we can identify physical objects with which we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , together , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains because our brain doesn &apos;t just accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about sharing different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think we &apos;re thinking about in our lives .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about , because otherwise they &apos;re just kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to obey a realistic outcome .
as you can see , these aren &apos;t three special images .
together , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that <unk> photographs should have the same perspective .
secondly , even the same thing should have been <unk> .
and these two images meet these two demands -- made out of the same height , <unk> the same thing .
third of all , it &apos;s about to make it impossible , where the individual images start and end and end it by connecting them seamlessly .
make it impossible to say how the photograph was actually published .
here &apos;s another example of that .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and it &apos;s been manipulated by the bottom .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to have compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to figure out the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , fish had been taken on a <unk> .
the bank is coming from a different place .
the <unk> is from a quarry <unk> .
and yeah , i even have the house up on the island of red <unk> to look at it .
so to get a realistic result , it &apos;s going to go from planning to planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of work that &apos;s been planned .
and if you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it can be pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that we need to do is the only thing that &apos;s limited to us .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced on the <unk> was to think of a <unk> .
and you don &apos;t think that &apos;s particularly scientifically , you know , it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and tea , and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- probably most of the electronic <unk> fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> , a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on it .
and every morning i jump to it .
and yeah , i have a job of how you might recognize .
i have my job at 95 pounds of it .
it works very simple : every time i jump to the scale , you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to <unk> them from my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support a lot of support , and i need to take a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else about that .
you might be familiar with this , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my <unk> and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could have patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play together with some kind of game to play their health better .
the next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give you this little <unk> that you have on an iphone or so <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure from home , to send it to their doctor , for example , to give him a little more than 100 dollars .
make methods that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these things , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around there .
we know one where all the gas stations are going to be .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would it be the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next <unk> <unk> was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we built a website , and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed at <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> <unk> were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we &apos;re designing a <unk> in the world .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> <unk> , augmented reality , to find that <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can use your iphone to find the next <unk> that can save life .
and we don &apos;t want to use this as a <unk> , which is called the product , but as a result , it &apos;s also called <unk> .
and we want to bring this into a global plane .
and we ask our colleagues around around the world , from other universities , about helping us to help themselves behave like <unk> to <unk> these systems around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and you &apos;re going to collapse , it will be your own <unk> or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us in the world to help us <unk> these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in his place .
please help us and try to improve the health , not just to improve the health .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to force ourselves to protect us from ...
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh , a minute .
it might take away until it &apos;s charged with it .
now -- we can just jump that out -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
no .
this is not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is there ?
okay . thank you .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like <unk> <unk> .
we choose some fellows , and we take them to work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and then they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so you meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
how did he get to look for this particular way of looking for help ?
we had a team last year of <unk> in boston called the code for america .
they were there in february , and it was a lot of <unk> in february .
and they realized that the city never <unk> these fire hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , noticed something else , and that was that the residents <unk> the sidewalks <unk> , directly before these parts .
so he did what every good student would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> it up to <unk> if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take you off .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
this is a humble little app that &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that fellows have written in the last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t make any other <unk> .
it spreads rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city <unk> , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them out .
and then seattle decided to use the app to use the citizens to clean the citizens of the <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced it to the <unk> people , when it &apos;s <unk> .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s spread smoothly , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the software account for the rule of software is a few years ago .
we had a team that was working last year at a project in boston , for three people , for three months .
it was about a method with parents who can find the right public schools for their children .
we got told later that if it would go across the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening .
there &apos;s now a project in the california justice system that cost the taxpayer for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it spread from <unk> , is a kind of shot on the <unk> of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it &apos;s a new generation that represents a new generation of government , not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a huge community of people who make the tools that we need to do to connect things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country that stand up and write and write every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i urge you to think about it because the things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ended up giving their power of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this transformation is happening .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , in the government , is that the government is about to choose people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all in the community in terms of communities .
this is the call to service and information .
you usually come out of that , if you &apos;re in your city , <unk> <unk> .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the cattle are <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of &quot; new urban <unk> &quot; in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t say if they &apos;re dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott was a human talking about human beings .
but , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , there was a neighbor in this way .
and the next point we got was , &quot; i went over there , and i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . alive ? <unk> .
turn the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital of the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great case of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of this platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help themselves .
a citizens helped another citizen , but the government played a central role in this .
they connected these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them with government performance if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper for government services .
if a neighbor help the other , we <unk> our communities .
let &apos;s call it a lot of money , which is a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they believe that one is the input from the other .
that our contribution to the system is going to be the case .
it &apos;s because the government is a further ocean , and politics is the top <unk> .
and what is underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and that &apos;s what we pay for , and we pay something that is working against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to get into the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned people who wrote a very detailed <unk> report that has an answer on the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , which is <unk> active .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to do what we need to do without improving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely vital , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , fundamentally , the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up , and there &apos;s a generation that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build just right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice to see their voice .
they don &apos;t fight that battle that we &apos;re all fighting to talk about , to talk to everybody .
you can do their opinion , on every channel , and you can do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the labor of the government .
and this apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be able to <unk> a fire hydrant to <unk> weeds to a trash cliff with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have been able to <unk> these fire hydrant all the time , and many people do this .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who pay taxes and receive services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
thank you .
so i &apos;m going to start to show you a single bit of a boring slide of what &apos;s going on .
so , you could just show the slide to a minute .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s rather about the general form of it .
and this slide shows the data of a analysis of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area of networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many others , are finding that we find in our field , a kind of a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here corresponds to a potency in <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we need to use this guy on <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back down .
another little bit more , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on <unk> curves ?
that &apos;s what it looks like .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would be on the <unk> scale very <unk> , in form of a flat line .
but if something happens like this , it changes the conditions of circumstances .
so if the <unk> <unk> would be as fast as the <unk> , then we could get <unk> into a cab and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
there was no before in the history of <unk> , these kind of <unk> growth , which increase the scale of all years , is rising exponentially .
the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that all of the time it &apos;s going to evolve all the time .
there &apos;s two possibilities .
either you will get a classic <unk> <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
so this is what it &apos;s about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s really what it means , then , that we &apos;re in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask you , and i often want to ask myself , is how many of these new world are going to be ?
what is this new condition that takes the world slowly .
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was another child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go through that .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year for a year since i &apos;m in this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there &apos;s something going on .
the transition occurs . we can all feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of making a sense of 30 or 50 years in the future because everything will be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now , i want to talk about what that could be , that transition in which we &apos;re right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk to you about some other things that have really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to go back to a step and look at the thing that &apos;s a longer <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at in the <unk> of the earth &apos;s life .
i think the big picture makes sense when you divide it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s a 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture of how they &apos;re doing it .
some of these oil vessels contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
and all of these were the ones that were going to start with this .
these little oil vessels were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but these oil vessels were not about alive in today &apos;s senses , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared it , that chemicals are distributed into disparate quantities .
so each other <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the knights templar , which has a greater composition of scale faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so these <unk> are going to survive longer , and it increases them in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , it will be when these <unk> were learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these <unk> have learned the ability to learn information , information <unk> .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe as information , and it &apos;s in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found a way in this <unk> , evolutionary kind of way that allowed them to have <unk> what they insisted , so that this information could be stored and copied and copied .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is going to store the information over 2.5 billion years where they were born .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s exactly what the exact same characters are using and the same code .
we &apos;re so far out that we can , only for <unk> , to write that code in this code .
and i have 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of <unk> <unk> .
in this case -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to use -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times <unk> .
so if someone wants to give a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i want to have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus and <unk> it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna layer of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , is very interesting , which were things completely different , which started to communicate these cells and exchange information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
and that &apos;s why the persistence of antibiotics grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay from penicillin , and put this information together with other bacteria into dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
these communication allowed now the reasons of communities , which were in some sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more than the evolution of evolution .
now , the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to <unk> that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting phase was about another billion years ago .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which are acting together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have lots of cells that are not asked anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to develop , so that the level of evolution was happening , not longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> , which we call an organism .
the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that made nothing different than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures that are <unk> .
so the neurons are the ones that have built these <unk> , which are the <unk> .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system in these communities .
and that gave you an evolutionary advantage to that .
because at this point , an individual -- learning happened now within the time of the lifetime of an organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit because they wanted bad fruit because she liked bad , the last time he ate it .
now this could happen within the lifetime of one organism , whereas about hundreds of years ago , because this information has been learned from evolutionary data from the individuals who died because of these fruits were not there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> using this particular <unk> , because evolution could now occur within one individual .
it could be done within a time of time .
what happened after the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
well , as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
but it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m going to give you a <unk> sound of me in the hope of having a similar idea to create a similar idea in your head that has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to do it again as a unified organism .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is we &apos;ve got humanity , we &apos;ve started abstract .
we go through the same steps that have gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , how to hold data .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to do something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of <unk> little <unk> , where he showed a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right front of your eyes .
so now , we &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> .
the first steps of history that i told you is a billion years of a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , is a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so forth , less than a million years ago .
and those next steps , like electronics , have just seem to take a few decades away .
the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> the word for -- if something improves its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process of being fed from itself .
i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , without the recently , without progress in computing computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a great complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any individual transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it &apos;s got billions of people .
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using lately , is the evolution of evolution .
and this is where we install a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the brain .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please have a hundred million randomly chosen sequences .
now , please take all these randomly chosen instructions , all the programs , and pick up those programs , eventually , they &apos;re the closest to my <unk> . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want to do .
let &apos;s say i want numbers , which would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve been using .
so think of programs that can be the most popular .
now , of course , the chance of random instructions is very small , that they &apos;re very small by coincidence , so they don &apos;t get any instructions actually to do this .
but one of them likes to be lucky to do two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have come on the next one .
go to the rest of this , <unk> the rest of it .
now , all of a sudden , all the <unk> that are best placed on numbers .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of two programs .
now , i have a new generation of programs that arose through combinations of programs that have come into a little closer than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
let &apos;s give a couple of mutations .
and try to get the whole generation out of it .
all of these generations are just a few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
i eventually get programs that can sort of sort of sort of set up .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i ever could write from hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand it .
they &apos;re obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job of that .
i know , and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because her life depended on whether they did it right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a map and says , &quot; oh look , look at it . look at it .
there &apos;s , &quot; this aircraft is made out of <unk> <unk> , which work together to make their flight safer . &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to create things with a much greater complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
so this is how technology <unk> us .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we can make these processes faster .
so it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , and the analog is at the time , as a result of <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make it very much what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this room .
but i really believe that it comes to us .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we &apos;re the product of evolution .
and i think all here is part of the creation of what &apos;s always next .
now the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m listening to now before i &apos;m going to get more <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the 1960s in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that nothing changed since the age of ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians at the time , we were jumping into a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
when the big indian <unk> <unk> <unk> thirst , he took a bow , shot in the floor and the water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i was getting a fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to lose the sunset that can enjoy without camera camera and tweet with my friends .
i found that technology should be able to do magic and kill them .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver <unk> .
this piece of old technology became a <unk> thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and <unk> ships in my imagination .
i came up with it as a thought of our fancy clocks and cameras to dream of .
they thought about being inspired by it .
and so i went back to the world of technology to see how i could use them to give magic rather than killing magic .
by 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> now , an interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; make your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box is heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter to me , and again , a letter to me -- and the ipad knows where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
and the kid in me is really excited about that .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean that magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies were always looking at fireflies in a glass of glass .
this is how you have to blow the ipad out here and <unk> fireflies .
and they light the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and so here every book , and every world , a little <unk> that i &apos;m here to take here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map of it .
<unk> had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and <unk> and serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows itself at other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is <unk> , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught for thousands of years in <unk> chambers in a old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that counts with new issues like <unk> <unk> .
for the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their pockets , on their computers , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re going to send a search for a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads image of natural objects .
as a child , i had the collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this <unk> will be <unk> . you have to go out to take a picture of a flower and tag a photograph of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> and tag it on .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online online .
a child in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today , i saw a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took in .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to do a interaction where you use the video of the ipads , and you see a animation from <unk> reality that appear on a plant in front of the house .
in one place , there &apos;s a screen with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , blow them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move towards a world where the nature of the technology comes closer and closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids closer to the natural world and to be closer to the magic , fun and love our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor to me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the <unk> and in places that have a lot of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , and listening to how stimulating this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of force to see .
in the short time here , i got a clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence the world .
and sometimes if something about ted comes , it gets a sense and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen a couple of fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of the teacher have meaning , but the words of a committed teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn it in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had influence .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
and she said to me that i could barely breathe . then they got rid of me .
one or two hours later , when i came across her , and she came up with me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and when i said no , she said to me again . if i said , &quot; yes , she left me .
it was something that made you feel that you wanted to be near your own .
the only problem is they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention to .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> , and he sat down .
i thought first of all , i thought that was a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and it went to me so 15 or 20 minutes . she stood up , and she took me to my hand , and she said , &quot; come on , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i still remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
and she took me out , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise you that you don &apos;t . &quot;
i said , &quot; minute , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
and she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see you see you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to tell you that mom will always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you that you &apos;re going to care . &quot;
i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , that i will do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; as next , i &apos;m always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who was older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and took this <unk> beer with my sister , and i got my sister and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> out there like this .
and he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took it , and then she took me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . do you . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , you &apos;re going to do this . you &apos;re going to do anything else we do .
i had what your sister had . come on , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you just do . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what do you do . &quot;
and then he saw me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make yourself crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren they are special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to admit to you .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps a public race .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i <unk> that i never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i &apos;m saying that , because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us that they don &apos;t think about .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was at prison during the <unk> .
my uncle died from <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these are the issues we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are released on <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
and i think the world is fundamentally changed by the world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population of the population , despair and hopelessness , there are the changes that are happening .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles over philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- there are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men in prison , in prison , in <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treat much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , affect the outcome .
yet , we seem to be happy to be happy .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact line .
and i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> developments .
my home of alabama pulls the <unk> if they &apos;re convicted .
here , and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black people lost their lives .
we &apos;re <unk> that in 10 years the percentage of civic <unk> will be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that <unk> kids to death in prison .
in this country , there are children in this country with children without using <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of time .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is a really interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is that the true question is : did a human being to die for a <unk> crimes ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question , right ?
but you can also think differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other way , the other way is , did someone make somebody a crime , but did we deserve it ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty death is defined by error .
on nine people we were executed , one that we &apos;ve been on for innocent employees , the <unk> and out of death row .
an amazing <unk> , one of the nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly a plane if for nine airplanes , the bottom , one crash .
but somehow we &apos;re going to do it by this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden of money .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and asking if we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m <unk> my students <unk> history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with . &quot;
and after that terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of the <unk> motivated <unk> and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we did in historical context .
we &apos;re constantly bumping up .
we &apos;re going to create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to take us the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> don &apos;t get to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given a few talks in germany about the death penalty thing .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death in germany .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever have to kill ourselves for the systematic people . &quot;
it would be <unk> by us , conscious and sensitive people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people <unk> , especially when there were a lot of jews &apos; jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental view of it .
i think our identity is endangered .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities of suffering , abuse , abuse , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it seems to me to merge both .
because we ultimately talk about the fact that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to a complex world .
for me , the time for me means to think and talk about the poor , the <unk> who will never be at ted .
but thinking about a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we appreciate it .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by faith in our hearts .
it &apos;s that <unk> , which i think is driving us not only to be open for all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said , &quot;
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to be all kinds of things . but what we needed most was hope to be hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be able to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also that the <unk> needs to be involved in it .
there &apos;s no distinction about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity demands very much more of us than if we didn &apos;t want to do that .
it &apos;s going to be profoundly <unk> .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink parks .
so these women were meeting , and they were just talking about it .
and then , to called a woman called me and said , &quot; <unk> , female parks coming into the city . we want to talk .
want to be <unk> and listen to it . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , really like that . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen to you . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard about it .
it &apos;s been so inspiring , it was so inspirational .
one day i sat there and heard these women , and after a couple of hours , women went to me to tell us , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the relationship is for the same right .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
<unk> want to help people <unk> innocent convicted .
we want to fight bias and fight discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eradicate <unk> <unk> without a human <unk> for children .
we want to do something about the death penalty thing .
we want to lower the numbers of death .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this will be very tired . &quot;
then woman refused to me to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways of thinking about these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our own humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things in the world .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
if someone lies , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s because there &apos;s a fundamental human would to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so much .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
ultimately , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and mighty and privileged , but how they handle the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to start to understand the true amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story of the end of it .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m going to tired of how we all do .
sometimes these ideas go ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted too very hard <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> and visit a client who might be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be the adult in court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a kid .
and one night , i stayed too long and thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something different , then he needs to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish them .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it really well , i started working on a legacy .
i had a <unk> , poor black young boy as clients .
and i started to proposed to this . the headline said , &quot; define my arms , <unk> black clients like a privileged to treat a privileged white <unk> . &quot;
in my proposed , i explained that <unk> will be the <unk> of the <unk> and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country that there &apos;s nothing more important in this country that there is only failure .
the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i didn &apos;t mention this crazy word , or actually had written it .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to court .
a few months away , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to put in the court and make this crazy case .
and i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to court .
and i thought it will be so hard , so painful .
and then i went from my car and went to the staircase for the dish .
when i was the staircase for the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered to me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of it . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability every single person to help a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you asked that crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started talking .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors walking across and down .
he always looked through the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
and finally , this older black man came up with a very very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat right behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , judge the judge quit .
and during the break , a <unk> came in , which was felt that the janitors were in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran across to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
i come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but that it <unk> justice .
that we &apos;re not completely designed as people as we &apos;re not doing for human rights , as long as we do .
that all of our lives are associated with survival every single way .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and in front of all of you , i want to look at those of you who just say , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give them .
they have seen an obvious wish in this community , and they heard an obvious wish to help them and do something .
what can we do yet ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s actually about a effort to do a little bit , something from the <unk> <unk> , which is otherwise in the politics of punishment .
here , for example , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty <unk> for a billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet <unk> percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t end up with a <unk> .
56 percent of the <unk> won &apos;t come from court .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something about it .
now , this <unk> will suggest the money to invest in more <unk> and safety .
i think there &apos;s possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the <unk> has been huge in america .
this fact is often asked in a context with increased <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change a lot of time .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> crusade .
so the dramatic number of numbers come in the prisoners .
we were <unk> by the rhetoric that we have in the <unk> .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; <unk> , &quot; people who bring people on the side of the grid , for a <unk> , for theft of good things , instead that you forces them to give the victims to each other .
i think we need to do more to help people who become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think that our current doesn &apos;t help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they really have a string to vibrate .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you .
bin laden is getting an increased <unk> with himself .
two : famine in somalia , three : <unk> the police .
4 : malignant <unk> . speaker 5 : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . seven dead .
eight : <unk> 9 : <unk> , <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> , mass destruction .
recession . <unk> . egypt . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that media prefer to show us negative topics because our understanding of these issues is given to attention .
and there &apos;s a very good reason to do it .
every second day , our senses are starting to start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because none is more important than our survival , the first station for all the information is a part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our system system , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> all the information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand is very true .
well , with all our digital devices that seven days ago , that week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re not a pessimist .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but perhaps this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality of that .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , is so strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already been .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at anticipate problems at a very long way , but ultimately , it &apos;s about to overcome .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the evolution of the world .
in the last 100 years , average life expectancy has more than doubled to inflation in the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
child mortality has been reduced by a tenth of a time .
and it comes from the fact that the <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> , and they &apos;re going to reduce it dramatically .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently living in a peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , it &apos;s gone from 25 percent to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations of all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
think of that as a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , <unk> , tv , mobile , air conditioning and cars .
the richest brothers of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , had never been able to dream like this .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and these are growing things that grow up .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that becomes information technology is going to be large on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less than a million times less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at that curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is , in good times , war or peace , war or peace , depression , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
they slow down for none of our big problems .
in addition , despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left side , it &apos;s going to be up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everybody .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer at the risk of being seen .
but it was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human adversary . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that artificial intelligence ran in every owner of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i started here at ted a new university , called singularity university .
we bring our students all the way together , with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies and services that can be positive and services within a decade of people &apos;s lives .
think about that one group of students today can affect the life of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , we can <unk> on dozens of companies that have been able to do this .
if i think of it , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury on every planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s going to be important to create <unk> goods .
and scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example of it .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> themselves , <unk> themselves .
the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent takes it , it won &apos;t be a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> was designed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with <unk> more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> energy shows all the 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news for that .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy fell in the last year for 50 percent .
last month , this was published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states will cost solar energy per gallon , compared to 15 cents in national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance of it .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember , as carl sagan &apos;s <unk> in 1990 , when it was <unk> on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> of life .
we live on a planet that has 70 percent covered with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of seawater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now it &apos;s a lot of time .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the road , <unk> .
it can generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether seawater , <unk> water , latrine -- and all this for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola &apos;s just <unk> to start a large <unk> with a hundred units of the world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very hopeful , then coca-cola will apply this technology global in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , you &apos;re going to do my goodness , and we &apos;ll soon get the 70 percent of mobile phones from mobile phones in the world .
think of the fact that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better <unk> than president reagan had 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication and communication , as nobody could have ever predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i spent a thousand dollars spent -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology for medical imaging and music are literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what &apos;s expected to do .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the <unk> with the <unk> that &apos;s like &quot; $ 10 <unk> <unk> x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a cell phone that you can talk to with the device , because it &apos;s ai with ai , you can test it or test it .
and to win , the device has to diagnosis a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> device that &apos;s not known , it calls the health center and prevents a pandemic before .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for people .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the largest <unk> against a population explosion is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people in 2010 .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to grow out of two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds that we never heard before , will join global communication .
what does these people need to do ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want to do ?
and instead of the economic conflict , i see one of the largest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re getting healthier through the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;ll be trained by the <unk> , and by the way , they &apos;re going to have the ability to use 3d printers and &quot; <unk> computing , &quot; and so to be more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of <unk> <unk> .
as if it &apos;s a set of new , never before <unk> , never before .
what would it be like to say the oppressed , wherever they are to make a voice to be aware of and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring out ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that little teams are able to do that by passion and focus , extraordinary things , things that can be done in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me about that .
there &apos;s a program that might be a little bit more likely to know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it &apos;s developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore how the protein is going to develop .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function of function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so this is a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by the university professors , etc .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people who play the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern , the human pattern , is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
ladies and gentlemen , what enormous faith in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to provide ourselves to the great challenges of our planet .
we &apos;ve got access to exponential technology .
we &apos;ve got the passion to do this .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to have the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect a few extraordinary decades ago .
thank you .
i think we need to have something to do with a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s going to start with a medical physicist , and i think that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , when i can give it to me a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to give it a piece of my own <unk> .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball player .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup of the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is filled with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them in the world .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon , and it turns out to be statistics and make a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to share with you a statistics that i &apos;m hoping most of you have already heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat represents 300 .
that means that the player is safe from 10 beats , <unk> .
it &apos;s called the ball <unk> , he comes up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to flip the ball to the first base , it hasn &apos;t been done in time , and the institution was in safety .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> <unk> in baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> <unk> .
this is someone who &apos;s certainly hit four from 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> baseball player , the last <unk> baseball player , was met by 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i &apos;m going to feel more comfortable , or maybe a little bit more comfortable after that i &apos;ve talked about it .
suppose they have a <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> that is <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s in 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s a lot better , it &apos;s on the <unk> of it .
and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think they &apos;re like to do the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , to be a <unk> .
1,000 , very good .
the truth is , nobody in all the medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be .
what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re going to share each of them , including me in the world to be perfect .
never making a mistake , no one makes it on the details of how to do this .
and this is the message i took in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> <unk> student .
in high school , once a school teacher said , brian <unk> would learn to learn a <unk> .
and that &apos;s what it was like .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> in the sisters of the toronto hospital , <unk> by here .
i learned everything memorized .
in my <unk> <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> of every single artery , each branch of each artery , <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;ve been collecting more and more .
and i was good , i filled with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew everything memorized and knew everything as well as possible that i could be immune to the power of errors .
and it worked for a while for a time until i met a woman .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto as a woman printer to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
at this point i was feeding the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my assignment when the <unk> was looking for <unk> advice to study the <unk> .
and give the feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i share her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered under <unk> failure .
this is a condition where the heart fails , rather than pump all the blood on the lung , put a part of the blood cells in the lung , and you get it gradually , so the <unk> came .
and that was not a hard way to diagnose it .
and i asked them , and i took them to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over one period of time , one of the years started to feel better .
i felt pretty good about that .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take the <unk> and did what i should have been , which was a call to him with him , so that he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew she would have been able to do additional information to their <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reasons .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be successful , and so to take his responsibility that i was like , and i would be able to worry about it without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and i sent them home , and i <unk> a happy voice in me who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;ve been missing so much about <unk> that i asked the nurse , which is to take a girl , &quot; believe that it &apos;s okay when they go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in <unk> fashion , &quot; sure , i think it will be good . &quot;
i remember that when it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> came and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i went on to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , leaving the hospital , and went home to go home with the car , when i did something else i couldn &apos;t do .
i went from the <unk> to my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after ms. printer , but another three words to me , and these three words fear most <unk> that i know .
but other doctors fear these as well , but the <unk> is very special , because we &apos;re only seeing the patient &apos;s patient .
those three words , you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient who was waving them home ? &quot;
asked the nurse &apos;s nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; he said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back to that .
she was back to die .
about one hour after that she arrived at home after that , they collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the family called 911 , they brought back to the <unk> with a blood blood pressure , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she barely breathing and was blue .
the <unk> pulled out all the strands .
they gave their <unk> .
they <unk> them on the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was in the inner <unk> .
and i used to go through these rollercoaster , because they came after the <unk> for the <unk> and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized she would never awakening again .
she had not suffered a <unk> <unk> .
her family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they found themselves in the <unk> .
the <unk> day , they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you know , you never forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
if you do <unk> <unk> , and you never do it again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one who makes one in the heart of the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that says one thing that you &apos;re doing is not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t based on my <unk> , it was very sweet .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he &apos;d <unk> the <unk> , and i &apos;m sure i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself to do this .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why did i do it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better about it .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i told me maybe i can feel better again .
and i was with me that if i double my effort to perfection , and never again a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working on it .
and then it happened .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of us in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent it on .
and even when he walked out of the door , he showed up to his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to get a conversation in their office .
and she said the three words , do you remember it ?
&quot; don &apos;t you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the upper <unk> and causing the <unk> .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt me <unk> , and went back to work and went back to work until again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve missed two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of time , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no disabilities in their treatment .
i thought he would have been <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys . when this was without <unk> , my colleague asked the <unk> of the patient in the lower right sector and called the <unk> <unk> .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues too .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was a <unk> in the right lower sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and they were good at them .
both cases of <unk> , <unk> me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , which happened to be a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , <unk> and without support .
here &apos;s the problem , if i don &apos;t close to my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk the silent voice that tells me what really didn &apos;t find , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did the last time you heard about someone who was talking about <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you want to hear about any other doctor , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
and in fact , if i knew , or my colleagues , that a <unk> would have lost someone &apos;s wrong leg , then they believe i would have trouble looking at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of failure .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who are making mistakes and those who are not doing . those who <unk> <unk> and the shake , who are with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction to the antibodies that attack one of them .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we ban those who are willing to do the errors from medicine , we will depend on a safety system .
but there are two problems in this case .
and what i learned is that mistakes are completely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to happen every day in a system that is either a wrong or wrong <unk> , which is always a wrong or wrong , and it will be more and more , and devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians are dying of <unk> errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine took up the number of 100,000 .
both people are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
in a sense that medical knowledge , every two to three years , is doubling every two to three years .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have an cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> and give a slight breath , and suddenly the story <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same time .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things like that .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not talking about their symptoms in the same way .
all of these things are completely inevitable .
so if you take the system so i &apos;ve been taught , and i &apos;ve been edited out all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end of the end , no longer left .
and you know , you know , the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and then their pupils extend , they &apos;ve reached front of their head , then look down and swallow hard , and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
what they need is an environment that enables them to be able to do it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the newly defined doctor is a human , knows about his humanity , remember , not proud of making mistakes , but to learn anything out of them that can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
it <unk> when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other their errors , not about <unk> , but in a loving , supportive way that all of them benefit from .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if it &apos;s like , people also make mistakes from time .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the first defined doctor .
i &apos;m a human , i &apos;m making mistakes .
i <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to learn to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea of it .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories earlier , to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was <unk> .
you might think that he <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s not true .
he actually collected the fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until in the &apos; 80s , he was in big style .
it &apos;s now in the red list of endangered species .
we heard this story many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally the same .
the <unk> always describe it as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate it in .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really mean that .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was <unk> and <unk> from a pair of mangroves .
there was <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen lived well , and they were very good at ghana .
when i went back to that 27 years later , fish shrunk to half its size .
now , adults are taking five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it &apos;s still private .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it changed everything .
my third little story tells me about the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , rather at the beginning of &apos; 60s -- europe is a lot of <unk> .
<unk> meant countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing industry that started this pretty ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
and i went to mit , and we ran on the entire southern sea of ocean and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
i know now it was the reason of the ocean .
ninety percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected with the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there , the little dots there were <unk> .
and basically , the bottom of the ocean was deck and then back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you have an survey , and then you start with the commercial fishing system .
the reason is changed . out of this case -- a hard reason , or soft corals are <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw them away because they were dead .
and once we started with a life .
it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> all the time will be collected by fishermen , if they drive in areas that have never been left .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we &apos;re changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adjust our <unk> of the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves what was there .
if you look at it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the green of their country .
at time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions were completely natural .
every generation looks at the images that they take in the beginning of their conscious life as usual , and all of the time it comes from it .
the difference is going to be a loss of loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses to it .
it can give the order of changes .
and at the end of it , they just want to get the <unk> left .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s the goal of that .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not more like they were .
you could think that the problem was in humans that certainly lived when they lived in <unk> societies , and they just killed them after a few generations what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that was very often used , only once , before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of natural animals .
you still lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it won &apos;t be seen as a huge loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the large animals and in the ocean that are the large fish .
they become less than we &apos;re catching up with .
there &apos;s a little bit of fish on time , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept it .
now , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people will recognize , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
you will confirm it because the evidence , as you can do in a previous form , is not as much as you would like the evidence to argue .
there &apos;s an example of the anecdote that the report in this area was shown in this area that was great <unk> in this area , or not being used by <unk> , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientifically . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role that can play a marine area .
because through marine reserves , we &apos;re basically going to go back the past .
we ask the past again that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> has changed and are very low .
so , you can see the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the view that it allows to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time in the world , 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and the <unk> , maybe you remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
when you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; when you think about why people were touched by this -- except from the <unk> , why were they touching the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s been lost .
so , my only one that i &apos;m going to give you , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you , is in cameron ii , so it rotates with the avatar .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist <unk> , you had to register when you owned a typewriter to the government .
they also had to register a sheet of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for that is , the government could track , where a text came from .
and they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would affect the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
this is what happens to us .
and nobody doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example where our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing ones today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several well-known cases of <unk> , <unk> , which their money made by attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , and <unk> <unk> and so on .
the american intelligence orchestra <unk> two months ago , two months ago , from mr. sam accounts here , and on this bank account , <unk> million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. jain is on its foot , and the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying it &apos;s more likely to be more likely that we become victims of a <unk> , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s going to be even worse .
in the future , most crimes , most of the crime is going on .
now the second largest <unk> molecule that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protest about one opinion , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous are moving over the last 12 months and have become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for money because anonymous , like anonymous who do resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there &apos;s time to be the case of <unk> .
it &apos;s a great narrative , what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
someone was hacked , and they had to hack the system .
and last week in a head with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior of this group , whether he was able to <unk> it for possible , because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of a remote hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> thing .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , if you have a website with a website , with a <unk> service , for example , gmail .
but can you , but if you &apos;re in a foreign course .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens by <unk> .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening for example in egypt ?
well , egypt fell in april 2011 , in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian <unk> <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this line , a folder was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a local company in germany who was sold to a few programs that were sold to a few programs with them -- very big frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so in western governments , western governments are providing governments with their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll have a lot of certainty about your phone .
but today , we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> machine that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> to collect their <unk> .
so if we think about these things like this , the obvious answer of people is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> citizens .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i have nothing to hide with it . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like to trust our governments is , but we &apos;re all right now .
and we trust , do we trust a blind government to every future , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it might seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> had been produced <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> from cement with a given measurements that fit together .
<unk> was very quickly the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into the ability to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a brick on the other .
in essence , the <unk> was going to become the <unk> of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , i came out of legos .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household , they went to every household .
it &apos;s estimated that 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego it made for everybody .
lego , basically , the <unk> , the building block of the world , took a building block for our imagination .
in the same year , the next year at the bell labs , the next revolution announced , the next building .
the transistor was a little bit <unk> , which was a little bit of us from a world of static , <unk> blocks into a world where everything would be interactive .
as a result , the transistor allows us to build much greater , more difficult to build , a brick after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only in experts .
i personally accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to do the design of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about that is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them out wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
so all you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build a lot more <unk> .
they add a blue to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you create a little <unk> .
take the switch out around a <unk> that is shown here , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
put it on one more effect for one additional effect , and they made a <unk> .
i will stop it .
the simple thing about the simple play is actually quite powerful .
instead of code , you need to code , or <unk> or <unk> them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to slow it out , they &apos;re looking to accelerate or slow , they just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread out of children &apos;s books and see them play with them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how they start to understand the electronics that they &apos;re in the daily world , and they &apos;re not learning them in school .
as for example , a <unk> system works , or why the doors of the <unk> were <unk> , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also been <unk> <unk> .
so we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started to play with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and they gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a lobster of play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> <unk> became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material available to everybody .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> download and make it yourself .
we want to be the world of creators , the inventors of the contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is yours .
so , pull out and start to invent it .
thank you .
