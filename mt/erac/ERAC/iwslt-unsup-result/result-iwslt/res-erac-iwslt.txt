and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to deal with the <unk> separation of death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing all singing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to guidance on earth &apos;s life .
and that &apos;s an idea that if you think about it , you can only fulfill a little bit of hope .
together , the myriad of cultures are a web of <unk> and <unk> lives that are the earth , and that &apos;s what the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere <unk> that you know as biosphere .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species of species .
and as the biosphere was eroding , this happened with the <unk> -- only with greater speed .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when everybody was born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the whole part of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means with the soul of a certain culture access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an idea of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half no longer are in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be a lonely way to be a lonely , one of the last of your people who talk to your language , no way to have to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect to expect hope to expect the hope ?
and yet , this terrible fate happens to someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because all two weeks , because every two weeks , and takes the last <unk> an old language with the grave .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
so i want to take you through a journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to understand them what was actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
and for example , take this child of the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they were <unk> the <unk> from the east of sacred snakes .
this is a people that are not cognitively between the colors and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people depend on , is <unk> .
they have a curious language and a <unk> called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who talks a different language .
all of this roots in the <unk> past this big houses in which because of the <unk> six or seven languages , but that you never hear someone who learns a language .
they &apos;re just listening to and start talking about it .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was caught in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> , and made a <unk> mistake , and made a <unk> mistake .
they took shiny photos from the air out of the air , which we would evaluate as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen anything in their lives in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , nothing and <unk> that this cards the devil business and killed the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t go and get the spear with the <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of forest that was amazing .
their hunters smell of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what species of this owned .
to give sense of this <unk> , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the <unk> knowledge and <unk> is not the cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the big world of africa , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will be left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa no religious belief , of course , there was a religious belief in sub-saharan africa , which is just the remains of these very profound religious thoughts during the tragic diaspora of <unk> <unk> .
but what makes <unk> interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gave the minds of the minds .
the minds can be <unk> from the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to <unk> the soul of living temporarily , so that the <unk> will be for a short <unk> moment to god .
<unk> says the <unk> , &quot; you know , go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become the god of god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , are you going to take from the spirit . how can you be damage to it ?
you see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal <unk> without burning <unk> , an amazing visualization of the ability to affect the body that this is <unk> when it gets into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people i met , the kogi of the sierra nevada de <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
progeny of the old <unk> civilization that the heart of the caribbean in colombia , and in the episode of the conquest , this people in a <unk> <unk> , which is rising over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that never been conquered by the <unk> .
until the day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
and during this whole time , it will introduced culturally in the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it out of it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so , <unk> are not <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> .
now , what does that mean ?
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , by the many of you , the most powerful preparation from the repertoire of the <unk> .
and this plant contains some very strong forms of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> , are very similar to the <unk> of the world .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you can make from different ways of making it <unk> .
this powder is about being shot out of a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be <unk> of reality , but the resolution of reality .
but the thing with <unk> is that they can &apos;t be taken <unk> , because in the human gut of course , of course , with the name of <unk> , <unk> enzyme .
they can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now the amazing thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are <unk> from exactly the way that necessary to <unk> the <unk> , so ask yourself .
how can these people from a state of 80,000 species of 80,000 species can &apos;t find these two <unk> plants that combine if in this way , to create a kind of <unk> version that &apos;s all bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless by meaningless .
but you ask the indian to say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , has 17 variants on the forest that they all see at a big distance in the forest that makes our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how to put their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you take each of the 17 variants in <unk> , and they sing to one in a different <unk> .
well , they don &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the problem is that even those of us who have the idea of us , the sympathy situation of native americans , they look at them as a <unk> and the real world , which is the real world , which is our world , changing our world .
all cultures have been involved in the dance of new <unk> , and it &apos;s involved in the dance .
and the problem is not the technology of it .
the <unk> heard not to be less on sioux than they expect , and arrow , when americans stopped , when they stop the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of sovereignty .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people is generally convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , is not just convicted , but generally and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering <unk> if you haven &apos;t experienced it in a <unk> level of time .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as a followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion of the world .
his uncle fled with her holiness in the diaspora , people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- for the crime of wealthy .
he was caught in prison for two years to hide under their <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live it without it .
the sister who did these brave did became a <unk> in a <unk> .
and one day she took a <unk> on a <unk> , and she had to <unk> it for seven years into a heavy camp .
the suffering <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really have a choice . would we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species might exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know them is hardly 300 years old .
well , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are in the next millennia .
if we ask these myriad <unk> to the importance of human questions , answers to 10,000 different voices .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of our regime , they were forced to pull out in settlements .
this old man refused to be the same thing .
the family who had fear for his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled were originally made out of fish , made up in <unk> , which is made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid of the arctic night or the flying storm .
he <unk> out , he took his pants out of <unk> and <unk> his hand , and when the feces started too cold , he shaped it into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> the saliva on the pages of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog with a dog .
he <unk> the dog , and he took a dishes , took a breath of the dog , and <unk> a <unk> , and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> on the belt .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t do anything about it .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit of the inuit and all politicians in the world .
the canadian government was the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a area that is bigger than california and texas and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the time in the world .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for <unk> with their people and achieve it .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling is not persuasive , but we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> to that .
our magazines are read by millions of people .
thank you .
we see a lot of <unk> from digital photos here that you can seamlessly , and <unk> , in a way that can make a difference in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen right now , it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> of a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it that way .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with several scales .
we also did something at the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is actually capturing these ideas to the screen for the available place on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean any more <unk> and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary to be necessary at all .
of course , this is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get a little bit of it now .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it out of the internet .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects two different technologies to each other .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research about <unk> , who from noah <unk> , a <unk> in washington , under the advice of steve <unk> on the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial atmosphere is actually meaning in meaning of meaning .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are which are a lot of <unk> that are <unk> .
we had to worry about because of the lawyers , etc .
so this is all <unk> , and they all are in the way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way of doing this .
. you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work in microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is about the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them who were all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange things .
many of them are filled with faces , and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster from notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now from all of the collective memory of what , like , visual memory , which looks like visual -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are connected , and it creates something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
so look at this as the sequel of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that people use it with the complexity that people use , and their use of application is always bigger for the user .
their own photos are the metadata that has been a different person in the world .
and of course , byproduct all of these are the immense rich models of each interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just by <unk> or satellite and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
. do i understand it right ? your software allows that at a certain time , within the next years , all images that are used by someone in the world are basically used to each other ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than discover it .
if you want to create them between the images of the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of <unk> information that many of these images have to be .
as if you do a <unk> for pictures where they put sentences in the website , which is a lot of information about what image that is .
but what if the picture is you connected to all your images ?
and then the scale of the <unk> and the abundance that makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope , in harmony with other things that you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works : if our goal is to maximize the common good of our citizens , this is all through the <unk> of the freedom of the individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is very good , valuable , useful premise for human beings .
when people have freedom , each of us is to do the things that can maximize our good good and nobody has to decide for us .
the way freedom has to maximize is choice of choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come into the sense that it would be in the sense of it .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives , too .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s going to happen to modern progress .
this is my supermarket . this is not a big deal .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and in this a electronics business , there &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together millions of different <unk> facilities from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy where you wanted to drink every phone that you wanted as long bell .
they rented her phone . they haven &apos;t bought it .
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and tweets <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it takes people to walk into business and ask this question .
do you know what the answer is to this question , right ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more <unk> than buy objects , the same explosion of choice is true of choice .
health -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a job or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like them and me , that if you think about it , because we don &apos;t buy sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : they expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change to the prescription .
so something as <unk> as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is to show this slide .
we inherit no identity , we invent them .
and we invent as often as we want to .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they could get as fast as they could , and then quickly got children as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who &quot; , not when they did .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry ? should i have children , or do i have children ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m <unk> and not a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl showed , with technology that allows us to work every minute on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you that the <unk> is working .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry probably on our lap .
and even if they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in the <unk> we ask our child <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world where we lived in the way that we lived .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we live in now look like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news that &apos;s going on .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what good it is , so i &apos;m going to be bad about what &apos;s wrong with it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of free .
with so many options that you can choose , people fall very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of this , a study about investment in volunteers of volunteers .
one , from me , had access to the <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old employer on the employer , took participation around two percent .
they offer 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees than if they were only five , why ? why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide that they should choose it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , will never come .
they &apos;re not in participation for 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> who would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of choices that are happening .
and i think it &apos;s the world that looks like this .
you want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or the wrong thing , the wrong thing about that .
so that &apos;s an effect . the other effect is that even if we make the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with the result of choice , than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more possibilities there are , the easier , it &apos;s nothing to regret that is disappointing to the choice that they meet .
second , what economists call <unk> <unk> .
dan gilbert has a big point today by doing this morning by how much the way we judge things that depends on what we compare to what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about alternatives , it &apos;s just attractive of alternatives that they make , that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have been thinking about .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone to the <unk> .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the idea that he missed the possibility , day about day , a great parking lot about a big parking lot .
<unk> reduces happiness that we get through our choice , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are to choice , the more attractive properties of these choices will take place in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example of that .
well , this cartoon makes some statements to this point .
he makes a statement about it now , and maybe to do things slowly about things .
but an important point that he is : always who they choose for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less makes .
third , <unk> of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time in the time .
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , slightly <unk> or big ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid ?
do you want jeans with a holes ?
you want to cut down , <unk> blah , blah blah ... &quot; and so on , he told .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour of all this damn jeans , and i get the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i had ever had .
i had better . all of these choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse about that .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt bad was , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than they just had in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , one of them would have to be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing to what i expected to do .
adding opportunities in life of people &apos;s lives are inevitably the expectations of people , how good these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even when the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this . because if you would , you all know what it is , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that all was worse than anything worse than anything worse , it was worse for the people who were able to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world where we live -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you ever hope is things that are so good as you expect them .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant because their expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all came -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i didn &apos;t have it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> to me that way .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing to be a bad thing .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one that is disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s .
they would have done it better to do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and also when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
and so the evidence is that it &apos;s actually better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember .
this is the official <unk> that we all hold for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a choice is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice than something else .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time to make our good greater .
now , as an rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an rule of question , the thing about thinking about this is what all of these choice in the industrialized societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you whose problem is not to big choice .
your problem is that they have too little in it .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and diamonds is : steve <unk> has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help , it &apos;s a waste of money . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt the same way .
they &apos;re worried that we &apos;re bad at that .
if something of what the people of our society allow us to make is to make a little bit of choice in the societies where people would be improved , not just the life of people , but we will also be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> will worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> to us .
finally , read this cartoon , and a sophisticated person says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know about ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this room , you know ? &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point that fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , you don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> so that everything is possible , they reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and reduce happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost to limited with perfect security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what that could mean , and about the discovery new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lives and build new lives .
we always tried to ask significant questions about it .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists trying to understand and that in different levels .
we &apos;ve tried a different approach to simplify it to the minimum components of the building .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years when we sequenced the <unk> of the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate life or whether we can make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which can replicate the smallest genome of a species , and we tried to get that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to give it about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components , and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which was never done before ?
and if we can , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material , by the way .
our steps in the digitize of life were exponentially .
and our ability to write genetic code has increased but increased , and our last point would be on an exponential curve .
we started with a 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years before we did the first experiments before we did the first experiments .
it turns out , it &apos;s very hard to do that .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make the little pieces of dna , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces , and we could correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus to kill bacteria of the bacteria .
we made little pieces of pieces , and we made a dna molecule , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made a viral particles .
the viral particles were released from the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
and recently i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they could be able to understand this model .
they laughed more than her is doing it .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually building the whole hardware in an biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , these digital information must really be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the <unk> was a mistake per 10,000 base of 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes , if we used to use the original sequence of the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of things that are 50 letters long , and that with other <unk> to build smaller <unk> so that these fit together .
we have some unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built <unk> in the world .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
beginning , we just signed up with this .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve got the pieces so that we could just break them with enzymes , there are enzymes that are enzymes to break them together and bring them together .
and we started to create pieces , starting with pieces of five to <unk> letters , added these each other to make them together to make these together , to put these back to <unk> .
in every step , we produce these pieces of the surplus so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> , right ?
when we get to these right , with over 100,000 <unk> -- it &apos;s not going to grow for e. coli , it &apos;s beyond all the opportunities of modern molecular biology , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> called biology that uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything else was together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and can move to the search for extraterrestrial conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve used to use the right design of pieces of pieces , we have them <unk> , and yeast adds them automatically together .
this is not a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see with the <unk> of the brain .
these are footage over six seconds of a day .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about <unk> letters at <unk> code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule with <unk> structure that ever became created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances , it would include <unk> pages , just around these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus very simple , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re doing it in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about cloning .
but in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can transplant a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to the other , and can activate that .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to bring the process into something .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species of <unk> .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is changed a lot of biology , a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called enzymes called the <unk> , which are actually dna <unk> .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had a cell with a new chromosome .
it was blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added to the gene , right ?
and after a very short time , it had lost all characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we gave into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve read .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can move by the <unk> to change things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion where there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design system .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need to do .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet have existed for each one of the year , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh water and clean water , medicine , fuel for 3.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine times .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million drums a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge of it , a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that landed in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re first going to get the limits of biological reality and to those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you can imagine these 20 million different genes or these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can change with a very small team more molecular than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can go to <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> , and so on .
this is a recording of real <unk> that we work with , with which you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look like .
now we focus on fuels of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve recently seen corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation that will be coming out of a much higher cost , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way to think about the cost of biology or the limitation of their availability is when we see co2 as we see co2 as a source of co2 , and so we work on cells that go to these path .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the fourth of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way of that .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways of doing this .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane by using hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we can study whether we can use carbon dioxide that could just be brought to <unk> , the co2 in the fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals like the <unk> industry , right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? if you can &apos;t do that in ted .
but as we &apos;re working on the same way , we &apos;re working on the same way of using vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back and have a dollar back when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by using <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> bacteria , and maybe <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re looking for people to improve people . our goal is that we only have a chance to survive long enough to survive . thank you very much .
so on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works for us to explain the machine .
so it &apos;s time . and for all those those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever happened -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
this is what i work . he calls atlas detector -- 44 meters in the wide , 22 meters in diameter .
so here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction , so you see the scale of the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine was running for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge <unk> in the field of <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that the lhc <unk> at the lhc , then with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture in september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest <unk> , or this one , when someone went to the google side and was the front page .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
and about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires lead <unk> when the machine is running on <unk> .
well , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford it because if you &apos;re very cold , they become called <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , they can sustain tension .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and so the wires heat up slightly and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result of that .
now , this is even more <unk> if you imagine that the magnet over 20 tons , and it &apos;s shifted to about 30 inches .
so we damaged 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
now , they &apos;re all back to their way to their own .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it to him , and we expect first data in june or july , and we continue to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a kind of spark of accidents , the debate about science and <unk> is easy to reject that it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more of course than that .
it &apos;s my big , lifelong love and fascination with it as well .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change the way .
however , recent thing is strange in my life and my career , which has brought me to rethink my relationship with this work .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i come to , i would be treated as if i was the demise .
seriously -- the demise of <unk> .
for example , they come to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never <unk> this success ?
don &apos;t be afraid of that you &apos;re going to get your whole life , and never create a book that anyone in the world ? never again ?
okay , that makes really courage to be .
people said , <unk> don &apos;t have a fear to have never succeed ?
don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of <unk> kills you ?
you &apos;re not afraid that you &apos;re working for your life , and you never get to die on a <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? <unk> <unk> with failure ?
so , you know , you know the way .
the answer -- the short answer on all these questions : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had it .
and i &apos;m afraid to fear that nobody would see a lot of things in the world .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about , why ?
is that reasonable ?
does it sense that people should be expected to do the work that he feels to do the work that he feels ?
and what is right with the creative company , that they make us insecure about the other human state -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist he asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about you ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been the reputation of the <unk> of <unk> people .
but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to have this reputation , to be mentally incredibly unstable .
all you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great heads alone from the 20th century that young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who are not actually <unk> , seemed to be neglected by their talents , to be really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> : shortly before his death in his last interview , <unk> each of my books killed me a little bit further .
it &apos;s a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
the question i want to ask today is : is this idea for you completely right ?
don &apos;t you feel that ? because only one centimeter -- i feel like this notion -- i don &apos;t feel myself with this notion .
i think they &apos;re <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she gets taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we &apos;re our great creative encourage in life .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , this dark path of guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work that comes after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to tell you , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s probably that my biggest success is my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought of it is .
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring someone to the morning to drink nine in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love with .
so the question is : how ?
after a while , i seems to me that i can continue to make a kind of <unk> psychological construct , a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
and somehow i have to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction will be to the writing .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome of rome in rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close to it .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that came from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity , <unk> demons .
from socrates known that he believed he had a <unk> that sent him out of a distance .
the romans had the same idea , this kind of <unk> creative spirit , a <unk> genius of a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s a distance , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much psychopathic , right ?
if your work brilliant was brilliant , you don &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
when your work <unk> -- not completely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little paralyzed .
so people in the west have thought about creativity in a really long time .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational <unk> , and people started to believe that creativity came from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear these guys , or these artists , call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
it &apos;s like to ask someone to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> <unk> our artists of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to go back to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t get rid of the <unk> for 500 years of rational <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who are really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , <unk> , people and <unk> on their projects and apply to their projects etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey to this journey .
but the question i want to address is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes as much meaning as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- as everybody knows that it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- so in other words : in other words , everyone here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , he can feel really <unk> , sometimes it &apos;s a <unk> .
she said it would be like a <unk> train of air .
that &apos;s what the country would go on to you .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that she could just do one thing in a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> race like the devil <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- i never forget -- she said there were moments where they were almost photographed .
they caught the poem on his tail , and she moved back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and in these opportunities , the poem came down and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard this , i thought that &apos;s creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to work up every day and sweat , and sweat me and really uncomfortable me and really awkward <unk> .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes i have this thing called <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done that in the way that you have it .
even i had work or ideas that from a source through me that i can &apos;t identify .
what is that for one thing ?
and how do we get to lose with our minds without having to lose our minds , even in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can create this can be tom <unk> . i could interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist trying to master these <unk> creative impulses in him and deal with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was a day on a <unk> in los angeles , and there changed everything for him .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to come up with this old <unk> in him , like <unk> i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be tracking from this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of panic , he was just listening to the same thing .
he finished all the <unk> , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you see i drive car ? <unk> <unk> , can you see the car ?
so i look like this as i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , anyone else is going to be <unk> .
go and ask , leonard cohen &apos;s disease .
his whole <unk> has changed after it &apos;s happening .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as ever and ever .
it could be a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing that was not entirely tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it has saved me .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project of the project .
but then i remembered tom in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my look at the manuscript , and i talked to my comment on a empty corner of the room .
i talked about : <unk> listen , you know , you and i know both if this book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve invested everything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show here and your percentage of the deal of deal with it .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give the record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries ago in the deserts of <unk> people with sacred dances and music , the hours were stopped -- until dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened , one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen in your life , once you &apos;ve seen a performance like this .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancer through a kind of <unk> -- he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added together .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t seem to be pure in human beings .
it became bright from inside , and it &apos;s bright , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
when something happened , the people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
if a actors in spain has something magical , something magical , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , followed by <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wake up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s not a <unk> of god &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe it will never rise to these heights .
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name , call it , but what should he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard to do .
this is one of the most <unk> beach of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of <unk> , if they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence come from them .
if you might only believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life , when you &apos;re done with someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , that changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think in the last few months , while i worked on the book that &apos;s going to happen soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , frightening , <unk> successor to my <unk> success .
what i have to say to myself , if i &apos;m crazy , is not afraid .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
be on your contribution , whatever it is , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid god that you &apos;re asked to do is decide for a short moment of miracles through your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance yet , dancing by your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you to do with you .
i think , and i feel that we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , just for the mere human love and the <unk> to be there to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had nearly three million years of the lower 48 states , has shrunk to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t mean strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic is <unk> the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled red to red .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> , this is the annual ice in winter ; it reduces in the summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone here from here .
this is a problem because warming is the frozen reason to <unk> the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of carbon , which if it &apos;s <unk> , from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> in the atmosphere , that could double that amount if we cross this critical point .
today , there are some flat lakes in some flat lakes of methane from the water .
professor <unk> walter at the university of alaska is with another group to a different flat lake last fourth lake .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be us .
and one reason , this enormous heat heats up from greenland from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea sea level goes up , it &apos;s going to put it into the ocean .
and these rivers take a rapid basis .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers volunteered that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that happened over a few <unk> is particularly strong in the melt , very strong .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andean andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but when you &apos;re <unk> , most of the water is also going to be <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra <unk> of sierra sierra syndrome .
this is what the <unk> is .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
these <unk> in the world are leading to a dramatic increase on fire .
and the disasters around the world have really gone into a really <unk> , and we &apos;ve never gained levels before .
four so many in the last 30 years , like 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we produce 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the middle of the eastern pacific , the american continent west and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a radical decline in the sea in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more <unk> .
but we start to see a change in the world .
here are the ones that were released in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and the <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
at christmas , in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas on christmas .
one of the commercials of the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will get clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in wages and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has two campaigns in the life .
this is one , part of you .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top floor , and we put a significant <unk> on the way to the truth to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good now of that .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change , right ?
let &apos;s leave that with us .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of the main main for global warming is , the remarkable clean <unk> you see here changes everything .
look at it right , this is the today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security is the national security challenge .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all together is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free to free of this <unk> .
<unk> america : new electricity , within the next 10 years
a plan to bring america back to work and help us stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out of it .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty <unk> that destroy our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you , to the time of your childhood , when you played with <unk> .
as they realized how to reach the hands and <unk> , the <unk> and move , they actually learned to think and problems through understanding and change through understanding and change .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
and this question was so emotional that we decided to explore the answer and we developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move to the hand , you can perceive each other , you can take your movements and you have a screen and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically , why you can move to the hands and access to access and access to it .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are physical and a consciousness for their movements , each other and the intricacies of our <unk> with them , we can see with them , we can start exploring new and more entertaining <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> , and when i put it into a direction , the video is played ; if i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other &apos;s other .
so when i put them side-by-side , they make their interest in it .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you notice that you can also notice that , and you can get something nervous about it .
and they also feel their movements and tendency to be <unk> .
so an interesting episode of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color , how to do this with liquids .
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> , and i can use them to cast color in the middle , where they get mixed together .
if we overdo it , we can make a little bit of <unk> .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education as languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast trial , and the results will look immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of fibonacci numbers that i create with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
and basically , every round of time , you get letters on each other , and as you try to form words , you &apos;re going to <unk> these over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , then again , and you have a new <unk> and new opportunity to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on the media lab . i could move them to try it and try it and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are some people who test it .
that &apos;s our youngest <unk> , down there on the right .
it turns out he wanted to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they were just <unk> to him , <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the <unk> of the table that this character shows .
and he gives the sun to the sun .
the sun is coming up .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by using the <unk> , and you can put it on side side , it can interact the characters .
... his own story is invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story of open end , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have time to show you is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as <unk> , like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can put these sound into the sequence that you can organize in any patterns of patterns .
and you <unk> them by giving a <unk> to a <unk> of a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live like hall and filters , like hall and filters .
you put it with a particular sound , and then you tends to hire it to put it up .
and then even larger effects like speed and volume that you use on the entire sequence of the sequence .
so let &apos;s look at this .
we start where we &apos;re the <unk> in two <unk> , and that in a series , they extend it and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass with that .
now i &apos;m going to do some drums of it .
and now i combine the filters with the drums so i can steer the effect of live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by using the pace of one or another direction in the world .
and now i combine the filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it is happening .
and so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the front , but can improvise ; it &apos;s expanding or <unk> .
and finally , i can take the whole sequence of the sequence by the left to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which fit better to what our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the way that we want to give you the threshold of this new generation of <unk> with digital media to bring information into our world that makes our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations of you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m excited to be there , right ?
yeah , so what should be going on ?
i have to step back a little step , and it &apos;s busy with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology now for a few years now , and i started that for a few years , and i just wanted to know , and it wanted to do what i learned in the study of theoretical theory .
so , that was my primary motivation for the way .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this .
and i think that the molecular biology is in general , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is now extremely important , and much , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like these all genetically engineered plants on the <unk> of the <unk> .
there are craig venter now in the <unk> trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
and then there are things that are completely in the everyday life , which most people are not aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash 40 degrees laundry , are also genetically <unk> enzymes .
and you can continue the list of the same thing .
and so in the interest of this technology , i &apos;m just on this technology , i &apos;m going to continue on it .
so what is <unk> now ?
most people know that most people know this from the <unk> of the world .
computers <unk> , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
and that &apos;s kind of really sad to the <unk> , because it &apos;s not what they actually started how it actually started , and what it &apos;s actually about it .
and this is the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and it &apos;s been grew up with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s a whole <unk> that makes all sorts of things that make all kinds of <unk> things .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also program it , and i found that i find incredibly fascinating , and there i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
and that actually has just <unk> eight really shape , these networks , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now members or active people around the world .
but it &apos;s actually always about finding a <unk> access to this , to have a playful relationship with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> a network , which is actually more as forum , where you &apos;re talking about and talking online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of the way that they &apos;re going to ask , and then they &apos;re asking questions about it .
and based on these networks that made all the popular , just have a scene that i want to be a scene that i just want to <unk> .
here in the image on the left you see , this is a <unk> , so a kind of school , so a private school , a nonprofit school organization , where everyone can get to everybody .
kids , old , all kinds of people go out there to just move through it , they put a lab and look at what can do when these <unk> are on .
here &apos;s a group on the left is a group in indonesia , which is , but there &apos;s a lot of time to be a long time .
longer than these other networks , they &apos;re <unk> .
and they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in pretty much kind of <unk> .
and i got up in the other picture , a lecture in copenhagen at the medical museum in combination with an exhibition on an exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s not a young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually all united is this fascination , is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and also to ask , so , okay , what , okay , what do you know what you want to do , what you want to show you , you have an interest to bring you interested in this ?
so , okay now to hack biology , you kind of need material to be a bit of a material .
and you need biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and what you usually understand under a lab , which is so kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , only for <unk> , trained academics with ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that &apos;s actually to do that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of all the <unk> has actually evolved higher technology than most <unk> , which is really like most of that .
and the o hand with this premise with this premise brian <unk> was trying to do a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> and , yes , so <unk> , and then it has grown bacteria , and then it has grown bacteria .
so everybody who &apos;s already <unk> a soup is that it &apos;s done too long , even done .
and i tried to push this in my lab at a little bit , and then i &apos;ve bought a little bit of <unk> on ebay and tried to make a little <unk> analysis , so that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , so it &apos;s just to do home .
and this is <unk> , who just mentioned <unk> , this yes , as a kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , so you can see it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s from people who are at home , to large , so larger organizations that are still at home , they &apos;ve done more in <unk> form .
and , again , it went around , yes , okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values , and what are our values , our basis of the basis of that , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> of this to be a <unk> .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody just has the wishes to be his wishes , and what it goes to is , say , saying , then .
and i think , a very good code , a very good code .
and that &apos;s what we have that , but that &apos;s right , i think , i think , has relatively good , people are quite convinced by this .
and we even tried to get it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not there .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , even a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what projects do we actually do for projects like this ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland was that we wanted to have a so-called optical event or optical <unk> .
you see that at the bottom of it .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> , and then the laser <unk> the laser , and then trying to focus on this camera , to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it in it .
another project that comes from from the french group there was out of paris , that worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s got it like this , so a <unk> , or so something , so he has been busy with <unk> , his his favorite <unk> is sam <unk> .
he built this helmet , and he built this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then there was the visitors in the room in the room , sitting on this chair sitting on this helmet , sitting in the room .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , are then different lights in the room .
a pretty <unk> project was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states that has just to do with this <unk> is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to reproduce , <unk> to reproduce , so you can make them visible to see them .
and the machines that do something like this are pretty expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest ones go to <unk> euros like this .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of it .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
i think somehow that six dollars or something .
but in every case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clearly <unk> .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> to me with the <unk> .
so a project that i started to build was a <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two centimeters or something .
you invites <unk> to <unk> , and then you get the <unk> , and then i have that one that then , and then i put it on onions , and then they put it like this .
so the device that you see there is didn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s like my prototype , the thing on this branch , the thing on it , and that was the pressure was too high , the pressure was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and that &apos;s what &apos;s connected to it .
a <unk> , if you do it with water , you have enough pressure , so i think 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and so you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then you go into the onion to get in the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros , or something , <unk> so around the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , this is the moment that this is actually the core of the scene , and also to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information , that more people can engage there .
because , as at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to make it really good .
because if you read about it , it &apos;s not the same as you &apos;ve seen it , that &apos;s not the same as you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet as a <unk> citizen in society , you want to meet and join , you need access to knowledge and technology , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and then the <unk> open into the <unk> open and citizen science .
so you &apos;re going to be put in the situation as citizens , with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who <unk> at least on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people in the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , i think there are fewer people who are in fact , than actually exist .
so i know of some who didn &apos;t put it in the world .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people , the individual people .
and in part , with these <unk> , these places put together in there .
and that &apos;s in the beginning of the world .
as said , <unk> has only started to be the same thing .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> that are represented around the world .
and we hope , of course , that we have a similar way to spread , and then they &apos;re also similar to the same thing , so that still can be involved in people .
and i would invite everyone once to walk with it and try to figure out what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get enough energy , you get far far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work people &apos;s disease ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moved to as a designer , but also in the <unk> , and in front of all the things in the user , and in front of all the things .
and it &apos;s about how to start people in interactive media so that they can use this interactive media , and so they create a very different experience .
and i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models of <unk> , so the paradigm that in our biological memory , and that we have been encoded in our biological memory , and that we can create that by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> that you &apos;ve met in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s that the future is exactly in us , in our <unk> roots .
now , what are <unk> models of the way ?
i wrote four <unk> , and i want to explain to you a short thing about it .
so to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial time , which is the pre-industrial time of us .
to these <unk> models , that we have an principle of basically natural relationship with virtuality .
basically , that sounds unusual at the time .
but i &apos;m going to go to the same thing , and will prove you through trying to prove that also a natural relationship to virtuality is a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to talk about these <unk> models for these <unk> models , even though we use a <unk> language , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains itself from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition of <unk> , which contains the <unk> of linearity , and what we say is that we feel the linearity as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
now , how about that with the virtuality that actually is the most important thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove you to be a little bit .
how many doors do you live in that you live in ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> they live , and look how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they &apos;re <unk> reality , it &apos;s all without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a lot of time for example , for example , for example , the virtual reality in our <unk> , we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth has to be the virtual reality , which people have needed in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything in the pre-industrial pre-industrial times .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was playing .
in this head , knowledge was <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination , were also passed on knowledge .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality as well .
the interesting thing is , if i can do a little trip to a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time the human time was <unk> and medium itself .
if you think about a piece of time , you know ?
what &apos;s media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change in the way that we have a change .
but i get to talk to you again .
central tools of <unk> have been stories for always stories .
<unk> , preacher , called <unk> , were extra to keep knowledge in stories in stories .
and today we are still very , very strong about stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still <unk> <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child that has spent most of his life , the most of the time of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now , we think our love to stories depends on that we sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing from it .
that &apos;s a lot further back , in the pre-industrial cultures , in the pre-industrial time .
but for me in the realm of interactive media , as an amazing thing , we &apos;ve introduced by se in our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the north american tribe .
and the lives lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , from island to iceland to raise food .
and they &apos;ve done that with this , called <unk> .
you may know that if you &apos;re interested in this , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they have used to use the <unk> , or also <unk> , or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped by songs .
where the language of <unk> was <unk> by <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm , and these rhythm have shown the geology of a region , and of course , that you could <unk> these songs and sit up differently and go back to the left and also move back to the <unk> .
but why don &apos;t we sing to come from the top from a b to a <unk> ?
anyway , to navigate the same thing .
what &apos;s happening there ?
this is what happened to the <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve moved to this in the way that we call it a <unk> .
this is the age machine , and it &apos;s happened the book , and it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and that the own production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to <unk> a piece of <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us to be alien to us , and don &apos;t have to do anything with reality .
from the <unk> to the machine machine .
what does influence in our thinking of our thinking and on our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> <unk> is the pre-industrial cultures of the pre-industrial culture .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> over the course of the <unk> , through the <unk> of the <unk> .
and that is , instead of giving us individual individual , we have standardized , very common patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce even more .
we have a abstract language of a <unk> language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing in pictures of things that things don &apos;t have in images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to that things that things happen linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions like the <unk> of the <unk> .
what &apos;s left to us is the <unk> of the world .
and we &apos;re still arrested as a <unk> , very strong , very strong one of them .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the <unk> of the <unk> .
that sounds very <unk> and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which brings us to discover these possibilities back back to our skills .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain a little bit about that for a minute .
there are technical concepts like example , the <unk> reality , which means the extended reality of reality .
so , of course , this may sound like my talk , physically , we &apos;re moving in not existing , virtual worlds , just after the model of the <unk> .
and other example are the <unk> , smart systems of intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all of this need the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been at the end , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can get up for a second , so you can talk to the two about the project .
and i brought this project as an example , as a example , to be addressed to this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say about it .
which of course , of course , is extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they have very likely to look at the eyes that any people have people , or that they play with any kind of <unk> in the hand .
in every case , they &apos;re doing that in it .
this is a game out of it .
and this is believed that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world , and discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize to me that i have to <unk> so much .
you can explain that much better , there &apos;s more than a lot more behind it .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at where places were positive or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a very different map of a very real city of a very real city .
and we can look at this as well as a result of this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities is clear to us , right ?
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if these bag were there a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about that instead of being talking about it .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate what &apos;s in there .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious about it .
yeah , kids are from nature of nature , or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a designer of the house , so i &apos;m in , of course , with the subject of curiosity and how it changes curiosity again , and why we might lose curiosity and so on and so on and so on .
and that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re busy to use as a designer .
if professors are curious , they often get <unk> in such the n of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half of a year .
a <unk> of the subject of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the most designers starting with so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices up there , because things should always be more intuitive , always natural , more natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
so i worked with it when it &apos;s , of course , or intuitive .
maybe a look at it , maybe a look at it .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , we &apos;re going to move from third to the fourth <unk> or the <unk> of the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so of modern in the <unk> of the world .
every society is shaped by a <unk> , <unk> .
in the beginning , the <unk> of the language .
and what that means is that you &apos;ve found a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate with the same cave or in other areas , cities , cities , and have this kind of <unk> <unk> .
but the hirshhorn , but something very natural , something very natural , something very living on the ground .
well , you had to learn , so no toddler can talk from nature , but we learn it and we learn to serve and serve .
it then has been dozens of ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because of course , of course , the living language started to <unk> in form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive is , i start and <unk> it in stone and with it as i do .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage of when there &apos;s a life of alive .
but then <unk> came to this script as a <unk> , got it to be a <unk> .
then the next generation that we actually came to live in today is still alive .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> writing with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was as a <unk> , where <unk> , and others said , are actually insane when the people start reading , then the people , and that &apos;s of course , and that &apos;s of course completely <unk> .
of course , this completely confused us because we see the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
and these two worlds are just opening up each other , new and old thinking about it .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this simple society , these new society , these <unk> , are very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
now , not at the local level , but on global level , it &apos;s a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global basis .
not if i think local green , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then the whole thing doesn &apos;t work .
this is , from the local village , actually a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but total transparency . but total transparency .
as you know in the village at the time , who has what , and when , this is what happens today , this extension of our self is through these mobile <unk> on global level .
it &apos;s that we know global names and faster and better brands .
that &apos;s how it happened before the village before the village .
in front of the background , i just have to do it , what does it mean for us , of course , what do we have also <unk> , what is , for us , what makes the difference ? so what makes the difference ?
because often , people are coming , you can &apos;t make it <unk> , so everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , because it &apos;s not just that , and it &apos;s not just going to change it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
you &apos;ve also been working on the subject of perception and the <unk> of perception and the <unk> of the world .
and this is , of course , what you start and look at and look at and says , okay , okay , now i &apos;m just looking at the inside of yourself .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work if we were there ?
and what does , of course , intuitively , intuitive and how work works our channels of perception and how does cognitive work work ?
because steve jobs once said you to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it , to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the details if i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is the core of the core .
and to look at how do we process information , how do we take information from ?
to say , what is information about it , right ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word , but don &apos;t know what it means to be very detail about it .
but i have to understand in the core , when it &apos;s going to understand information to information , when going from data and information , so i know how to do things , as i know things , and of course , i can make things very intuitive , and of course .
and of course , how does design affect the perception of the world .
so a lot of natural , it &apos;s in a vessel , but i just see where &apos;s salt and pepper in there .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , he will look at the right first , where is in the right thing .
and on the left , and then hopefully to access that , and then hopefully that no sugar is in that salt , just to give the salt accordingly .
but also our perception itself , how fake it is to us , too .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same big , and yet our perception , depending on what we do in the context of things .
anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work with it .
there &apos;s a little bit of my glasses to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n of a life .
a second circle starts to connect certain or associate , which is the same thing as a result of that .
that &apos;s what you call a <unk> , or a <unk> that affects us in perception of the world .
important for the designers , that most of the first semester , the great <unk> , the great <unk> .
close to that , <unk> the continuity , and so on .
and then often in the third , we &apos;ve got to forget .
but that &apos;s an essential component , if you want to make things like this , just to make things like this .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is that this is what it is .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s according to exciting if you &apos;re closer to it .
so we have the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re from the back to the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
they &apos;re looking at it from back to the back .
and it &apos;s an assumption that you see something you see , you see something you recognize , <unk> circle .
this is what we &apos;re looking at , we &apos;re just going to see this before we see it back in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i have this <unk> cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also what comes back to that , and then that &apos;s what comes back .
and then it goes back to the back , because the back of the back and says , well , now , again , if what you see is what you see , what you see , what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s just going to be seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how certain things are going to happen , and what are these things that happen to happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know from you to this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described in the front of you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see this pattern of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what &apos;s going on .
anybody see something a particular bit .
a <unk> , right ?
if i saw that that &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know that you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now , look at the <unk> .
and on , you always look at it .
so this is what i &apos;ve actually got to do about it , that you don &apos;t know anything about patterns , but i &apos;ve got them to see them in a short time , and i have to see this dog in this <unk> picture again .
and this is this projection of seeing , <unk> , looking at it .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> of it .
so , very exciting processes that then then , in this , gray processes , it doesn &apos;t actually do , but here in this <unk> mass , it &apos;s just in this <unk> mass .
anybody know what three seconds is ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present thing .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i kind of look at the present in the <unk> , i can also bridge it by a very good way of doing it by someone with three seconds .
it just has to process as a present to the present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant <unk> for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what do <unk> need in milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the period where you fell in love with it .
that means that if you know this , you look at who you look at how long as long as you look at how long it can happen , which can happen according to what can happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions that we have .
that means that this first impression is happening in a fast fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we can protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think about this as well .
of course , the designers are not just concerned with the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> , but of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so , how about a human being with certain things as well .
so there &apos;s the practical functions , so that <unk> things or <unk> aspects of it , and <unk> aspects of it .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where i actually have to reach .
there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why are someone a little bit of a <unk> , where hardly anything , so <unk> money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
and we &apos;re more at the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we also have as designers of course .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface and the theme of which , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means how can i do a certain goal , or how can a users can achieve a certain way , as much efficient and efficient and <unk> a goal .
that &apos;s what it says is more the norm .
how can i make something possible to do it ?
can i use that directly or need me &apos; n , or i need to be a <unk> , or i need a training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s been <unk> .
that i make this just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you also have to understand that .
and intuitive <unk> , not just since apple has a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i just want to use technological devices that people want to harness .
why ?
because in the rule of <unk> , we &apos;re using this new kind of <unk> , which is five times faster , for example , five times faster .
you have to imagine that if you do something of classical <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , you just need an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can go to the home , but your employer or anyone will see you , you know , it &apos;s going to be on the four hours according to the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a <unk> for us , of course , to make certain things , also a certain thing .
and so when we go to the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line that was very abstract , where you needed to deal with months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that now is with the original neural model or mental model like the software , which is , you have a idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
so no more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor is a metaphor .
and that made all the time , but it &apos;s also a lot better , of course , and it &apos;s a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is a lot more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m designing as a designer , a lot more often than looking at it .
this is also a paradigm shift in the <unk> .
that i &apos;ve always seen that the look at success for success , just the <unk> is an app .
and then if i get a step back into this natural user interface , where i &apos;m with voice , with language , by <unk> , by gesture , by gesture and not more from mouse and cursor to drive things , i &apos;m still faster and left .
but again , that leads me to the point , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back my little friend here and see , what does this mean , from view of the <unk> , when &apos;s really intuitive now ?
and that &apos;s for us people &apos;s always intuitive , if i have to think about it as a little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think he &apos;s going to think about it , but they &apos;re just doing it .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we look at that that we can transmit existing <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use that as designers .
so this is , i can just put this an intuitive , human <unk> on a software , and to make the software a lot of <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most powerful <unk> of us , and now i &apos;ve already tell you .
this is what the <unk> is doing .
this uses each of us and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s an acronym , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that makes each of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or very intuitive or partly instinctively .
so the model is going to be in the womb and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without that most of us knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> , so in the sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s less often than a day .
and i can now take this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , as with the metaphor of the <unk> , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to use this in a <unk> .
yes , everybody has eaten cake of it .
je : now i &apos;m going to <unk> with the object , can again be <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;m going to get all the whole overview of this , and can say , let me just show you all the thing with chocolate for example , for example , on chocolate .
and once a interface , which is much more intuitive and very much more natural and very much of it .
i want to help you to give you a very certain aspect of curiosity .
and curiosity makes not learn to be the same thing .
that &apos;s why all these are and curious are , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
and i &apos;m going to do it now , basically all these <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality of influence .
and there &apos;s a central point of it .
and that &apos;s based on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give , you give scale to about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus every day .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth in the world .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones from it .
we could only glide as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t have phosphorus , and we don &apos;t have a phosphorus .
remarkably , it &apos;s that we &apos;re involved in something that was actually a <unk> , but not that &apos;s not that .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> of the world .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;re going to get much more uranium in the environment than being used in all the <unk> than in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium has been spread in germany in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take out of it .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , less energy .
that &apos;s not a protection of that .
that &apos;s like i would say , <unk> your child , it just <unk> three times more than five times .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction of it .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our whole earth will be used , or later a <unk> .
that &apos;s why the <unk> of the <unk> to think about .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as a first thing .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the <unk> is stored .
now we &apos;re going to build corn and 30 kilograms between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or on the square meter per hectare .
that means we lose at the ground about five five times more , more than new times .
of course , we can look at the <unk> , of course .
and everything is clear or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> are <unk> by <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , they &apos;re going to grow up the diapers .
these are all in the <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby needs about six <unk> <unk> .
we could reduce that about 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial to us .
so the question is , how do we go to these diapers ?
and by the way , men are not pigs to be pigs .
i want to tell you about that .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted by the tiny components of the solid feces .
the people about the urine of the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you tell the people that if you tell people to exist , if you say that , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you <unk> a population , you &apos;ll get the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants weigh about four more than we people .
i could take termites , but in the united states , nobody likes termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means ants weigh much more than us .
and because they work much harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , they &apos;re in the energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree about it ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be woke up as trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
happiness , right ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the <unk> of trees .
you &apos;ve heard about it a little bit of <unk> from trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be woke up as a trees .
and where you see , even as demeter , the <unk> <unk> yes , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> to go back to our own <unk> .
every year , we &apos;re going to lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back to loop .
and so we &apos;re too many of them .
alone .
that means we feel so guilty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all call that our own feces go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many of them .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to be less harmful , which is in terms of <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that &apos;s useful , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , the highest , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot , you would have emissions from the fact that you &apos;re doing .
so you can &apos;t solve that in all the time .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil where we get nutrients back to them .
directly , we can <unk> nutrients in this way that it &apos;s in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take waste from it .
in china , a <unk> today is still <unk> , so , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to get our nutrients back to our nutrients .
that means that the whole western <unk> draws it that the city has always taken , but the farmers never came back .
and so the cities had to grow more , because the farmers went into the cities , and the cities had to go further away their nutrients .
all the western rich are always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you have <unk> civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you invited to food in china , you expect to stay as long as you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you invited them to the food , not to the <unk> , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet how to get nutrients back to it .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas around 90 percent is back over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
and of course , this is <unk> , but the plants are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just manage .
that means it &apos;s going to go back to the <unk> .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built about <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities were ever <unk> .
they could just be a liter of <unk> , and then it would be destroyed over years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to write in germany , you &apos;re best free from all treatment treatment is in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> a little bit of it , but maybe you can help it .
because the <unk> plant could be the best one coming up with phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s all the way to do it .
we used to put us in holland now in holland .
the dutch government explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need that overall .
you understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> that &apos;s opec .
these are <unk> countries that are 40 percent of the <unk> .
and the oil is going to replace us by other energy energy , of course .
but you &apos;re not going to replace phosphorus as a result .
that &apos;s not about making the existing existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and , first of all , to ask what the right thing is , what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you have a <unk> , if you have <unk> , and they come with 50 <unk> .
completely inefficient .
but all of the way , yes , yes ?
or take a <unk> of it .
a woman in germany eats about six millimeters three kilograms during their life .
that &apos;s .
this is not exactly exactly scientifically , because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be in terms of it .
but a <unk> , even in this illumination , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very , very effective , yes ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency is <unk> .
to ask , what is the right thing to do ?
not to burn the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit better to lose and to lose the whole materials for cycles , but first time , how do you make cycles ?
think of mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water to make a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about to avoid , reduce to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , throw it right , right ?
in every place where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you create again .
but the wrong things about that .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
and as we think of north , it &apos;s <unk> .
there &apos;s any footprint on the ground .
if you run , yes , every footprint is the ground .
because the soil is going to die , the mosses , and the water , and the water is washing the soil .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow of the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum of it .
so don &apos;t save , let &apos;s avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like people in the high bow , <unk> coke from the car , to do it .
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , we have a <unk> , which is , at temperature , liquid liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re running out of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so these are two cycles of cycles .
it &apos;s not all of course to be <unk> .
a television machine or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using them .
just the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that you have to go into biological systems .
the things that are only used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all direct ads , and not for the company for <unk> , but for that you now help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we &apos;re not doing anymore .
yes ?
so if i go to eat and say , this is free of <unk> , then you don &apos;t help it .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s in it .
positive .
so , not like <unk> .
not toxic in the world .
but everything that &apos;s in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can see the <unk> on the <unk> , and go into <unk> cycles , yes ?
all of it is <unk> of it .
and if we can do it , of course , of course , for example , of course , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help me ask them , ask them to people .
hey , <unk> , do you really care ?
because they &apos;ve got it twice the time that it was happening .
and i &apos;m not sure if she really <unk> it .
so , help me with a little bit of this .
but it &apos;s happening .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been shown to be .
that &apos;s it .
we can do things now , if you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can put in biological cycles .
it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going on .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this one .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , which is made to go back into the circulation .
so again , in every store , you can browse the things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> of the <unk> ?
if the moment is the waste .
these <unk> are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
right there on the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
yes ?
just if you take these <unk> , you <unk> them , and take the powder to plants to plant trees .
so the baby is <unk> for the whole life , from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
yeah , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can still reinvent everything .
i founded a institute .
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and you can all get involved in it .
there &apos;s extra a club to get where everyone can participate in it .
so not saving , reduce , reduce , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i as a <unk> , i understand myself as a <unk> , so in english <unk> .
<unk> are the translator of the written notes in <unk> music .
so to translate from german to english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , especially if it comes to poetry or even about poetry .
it &apos;s very alien to <unk> , which we do with musicians with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just have the written notes of the written notes .
they think that the composer in the notes has exactly all <unk> what he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about just or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , if very seemingly <unk> , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers not smell of flowers to smell the degree of the <unk> just to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
this is called the interpreter of this <unk> data in another , which is <unk> , which is <unk> , concrete , aerodynamic <unk> .
today i want to translate what i else translate musical , so <unk> , even into a verbal language .
so a translation of the translation of translation .
so i prefer to do that all the way to the german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be <unk> with me in translation of the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as much as spoken to spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be to learn just reading grades and the right place on the piano or the right place on a <unk> .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint with .
the idea of the letters you can only see when you can do the language .
so for example , you need to use the learning process at least as long as spoken as the spoken language of language .
and there &apos;s also a <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , or you can also talk to active , or also to the musical speakers .
the <unk> work begins similar to like the one of a <unk> .
after first , after play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to get to backgrounds the emergence of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> , you know ?
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts from composers themselves .
you study the works that he created before and after after .
you ask the comparison to be .
the <unk> to write it out of it .
how and what did he feel ?
how were the lives of the society and the politics of politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in that .
you think in this time , by example , you &apos;re reading about contemporary images and literature .
but with time , you also have a rich knowledge about the composers , and it &apos;s always easier to play , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it and feel easier to feel in it .
the composer is always going to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now , the grades of everything as a reflection of the message of the composers , but just a framework , i turn this framework to make it back with meaning and meaning with meaning and meaning .
and i say to my own words , which could be written between this framework , which is written between this framework .
i play what these sound could have mean , which is to mean , <unk> .
now for me , and for the composers at the time , what they could mean for him today is to mean today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it &apos;s because it comes from my now personal <unk> .
it has to be in here for me , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s over again a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve developed as long as a long time ago .
as you see a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , to work , i would be going to work the same piece again on the same piece again .
and i &apos;ve got a day older , and i &apos;ve become the pulse of seasons , when the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer that the sound back back to home than home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience in the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
all of that influenced me , and all this is my experience with the composition of the composition .
it &apos;s a wonderful thing when i stand on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and it &apos;s going to answer that with a reaction to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we don &apos;t have so much , and what you can &apos;t samples from .
it &apos;s a great fun to make music , and they &apos;ve experienced the audience to communicate how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is a different concert , every concert .
i &apos;m never going to play a little bit more like that moment .
i can &apos;t play it today in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more experience than today , and so on my palette of the <unk> , much more <unk> , emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example of it .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was lucky enough to meet him very early , with 13 years , and so i was in my high school classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> for me is .
that &apos;s a <unk> part of the time .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; well , so ?
that has to be the <unk> of it .
because for me , it means memory .
he was about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not significant memories of the same thing .
i play the piece of every few years , and always it turned to me for me , although not the only note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again i read something new .
an example of this is a very different area , monet has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as he saw it in this moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece of it is comparable to this .
now , i &apos;ve been also older as chopin with <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived for only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even though i mean to be able to memorize them .
to keep <unk> , right with composers .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially , if he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to have about the spoken language of spoken language .
often , the <unk> is that you &apos;re just learning the notes .
you learn basically reading this , before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument of the instrument .
and then when all the fingers on time and right as it goes in the notes , then they come out of sound that sound like music that sounds like music .
when the accurate happens , the students get the <unk> piece of the <unk> .
nobody &apos;s going to talk about the <unk> of interpretation .
all right , so there &apos;s a fast piece of <unk> , that &apos;s a fast piece of play .
<unk> , slow .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
i know most of that .
but even when you put these data , it &apos;s still a little bit of engineering .
and yet , it &apos;s not a interpretation of it .
i wonder about it .
i wonder that you often forget a little bit about <unk> , a lot of time .
that is that to make music on the instrument that make your musical and feel your musical and feel before .
that &apos;s singing the way .
a child that didn &apos;t learn singing , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not do it by themselves .
this is like <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and idea of music , so it &apos;s about another way , so about an instrument to sound .
people who never have singing , have never felt immediately with their own body , how it is to form a sound .
make a phrase with his own breath .
the instrument of music is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal system , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> on the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays , with music , is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more music if it &apos;s a boring one .
not necessary to sing a <unk> or sing of it , to sing it .
every own music will be <unk> if you &apos;re constantly <unk> from the outside of music .
so , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing , can you sing , a , because you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing , right ?
and in both , it &apos;s not too late to figure out if you can &apos;t figure it out , or learn how to do these little muscles that hire the vocal chords of the vocal chords .
that &apos;s what you can train with it .
or c , because you &apos;ve got to tell them that they &apos;re <unk> .
and i wonder how <unk> competent was this diagnosis of the world , &quot;
did you have a <unk> or a <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to have no music to do it .
but what i would do is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also get them out of it .
well , you see , in all cases , nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand the classical music in classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but you can say , if it doesn &apos;t like you or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t give up to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to give up on classical music , because it doesn &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to them and say it &apos;s tastes or not .
whether the music is too <unk> or sweet .
tell what they feel .
and with time , they also get <unk> and want to want something more spices there or taste , even fine differences .
now , why do i urge you from my audience to be active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of art that you never look at is not going to be the power of life .
the food that was cooked by a chef or a chef loving , has to be eaten , not just looked or recipes or recipes .
so listen to please , if a music is played by it .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> to do it .
if in a environment where the adults are active music or at least active music , a child is growing up , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue for me now ?
and the child plays after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now , a blue flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
so that was the very first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation of it .
and what happens when you play a piece today that &apos;s originally written a hundred , <unk> , or even three years ago ?
now , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was no piano at the time of bach as a instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the <unk> possibilities of today &apos;s modern <unk> .
i can get the <unk> that had had the stream , on the modern wing , which can &apos;t take a <unk> <unk> .
also by beethoven , you know more when he had been deaf .
today a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which has rejected an orchestra from the time as a <unk> .
so the composers rely on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> what they only imagined in the spirit of the mind .
and what you would think of today in the spirit of mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you could have thought about .
thank you .
you know what envy is envy ?
were you jealous of it .
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
so when i come back , with my little v w , and i &apos;m going to go back this feeling .
i send something through the head of it .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to need a big car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his value in the first year .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to afford to be a little car , right ?
and then immediately , that &apos;s unfair to me , which is unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to make such unpleasant feelings like envy feelings like envy .
you can also try that with words like revenge or <unk> or something like that .
and i want to tell you something about this mechanism , or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with , which is unconsciously familiar with them .
the mechanism is from lying to the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard , if people say , nobody has to build a wall of a wall .
and then rocks <unk> to tell you the point of view .
in a lie of such a lie , the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes <unk> easy to check that it has different in sense of it .
it just fake them and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is that they have to deceive themselves .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to get a <unk> upright .
they can get less easy , yes , <unk> or also to collapse .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote talks that you might know about it .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once got a woman .
this woman has complained , the portrait wouldn &apos;t look like this .
picasso &apos;s saying , wait for it .
it &apos;s going to be more similar .
in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to know something , what artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist gives you something , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist gives you something like this a portrait of something you &apos;re really familiar with when you look at this artwork over again .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it couldn &apos;t look like you , and it will be more similar to them .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it appeared .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror and asked him who was the most beautiful , because the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true inform , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true inform from this true inform .
but we should just make us familiar with a woman that you can &apos;t say a woman somewhere else .
here it is necessary to understand what we understand under <unk> , again .
we need this place to do this lie that we can &apos;t live the deception without that we can &apos;t survive .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the <unk> , but also in science that great lies in science .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of people .
that the man should <unk> the monkeys and , yes , at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true what charles wrote there .
the person is supposed to be <unk> or a common ancestors .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent that people are aware of it .
why do we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge when it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live these <unk> in the world .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things in this way .
we need to prevent that people are aware of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism comes out and how the traces that he leaves on something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me about that .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to tell him , because he has a propensity to get rid of it .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire , &quot; right ?
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> in this place , there &apos;s something wrong with it , you know ?
i told my wife , whenever a man in a moral sense , the <unk> , we should try to replace it by using it by using it through the <unk> .
do that , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind gender .
so a little bit of the <unk> that doesn &apos;t care about the <unk> , right ?
they &apos;re interested in the <unk> of <unk> .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s just the second second , just the fire fire .
he signed it up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t tell his teacher to say that you like to put fire somewhere and excited when the fire was <unk> .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that others can do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism in the world .
and this <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that he can &apos;t say loud .
so , just like these words , we &apos;re also going to use the words of politically politically ads , over again .
in fact , we know something else is the case of that .
but we know when we tell this , the social situation is very sensitive to the same time .
we can &apos;t just do that a little bit .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that should work .
i want to show you what we found in my institute of the institute .
after what logic , these self-deception , these self-deception , a different reality as the ones that we actually know in the unconscious that they &apos;re valid to spread outside .
so , i want to show you two , maybe three examples of it .
the first example is what many of you know and some of them , and some of them don &apos;t need only at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so intellectual , says about leibniz , that &apos;s about leibniz .
and from this soul you think that you kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , it &apos;s called it in the latin , the <unk> , your present .
and if that <unk> then , then it &apos;s filled with the people , with the mind , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can <unk> the same thing .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s going to come from the outside of the world .
so we should see them as something that should be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to do with a lie to improve our world .
because now they can apply a <unk> to a <unk> .
you know , they &apos;re still familiar with school .
so this is a <unk> that describes a logic that describes us .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need a logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so to lie , you can just apply this logic to just be wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> has right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence in that .
i <unk> him in particular .
a third sentence that comes immediately from people who have a strong sense of soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have soul , that &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech , which is the expression of it .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are loud is correct .
and i can say that &apos;s all the time .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statements about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the <unk> is not a man &apos;s dilemma .
the logic is not a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can argue all the time .
but critically , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says there &apos;s no soul to be a soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are made right now .
and now our favorite consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something about it .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and <unk> .
because actually , we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses two sentences , and a third <unk> that looks like this , he can have something that looks like this , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we do it as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the modern , which is to fill out the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , you have to think about another <unk> subject , a <unk> from philosophy , present to the philosophy of philosophy .
and that has to do with that that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a scholars , which was johannes <unk> , and after that , the <unk> <unk> named the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that is made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a <unk> , <unk> .
and if you put exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should go to first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle of the world .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> to each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you take another example , so if you immediately make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing to do .
it automatically goes to the right thought , right ?
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , from the larger pile that put a immediately , then you have to feel that there &apos;s something like a free will to give you something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re here in <unk> , i remember the <unk> of brain science , and then i remember brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars called wolf , and he says , sometimes you say wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence , and say , if wolf has right , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read about almost day in the daily newspaper , find them in this third sentence .
and this looks like that who doesn &apos;t have <unk> , can &apos;t be driven for his actions and claims to responsibility and claims is <unk> .
again , they have the same thing .
in fact , you have to prove that there are something like <unk> , whether there &apos;s something like <unk> <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as the first sentence of the first sentence , you have to take the opposite without evidence of course .
and now you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , these courage are practicing to be a lie .
take this for example , if you can see a people that you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> in the way that you can say that , right ?
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is called prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little bit politically <unk> , a little bit of <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> in the world .
immediately , you &apos;ll be one of these <unk> , of course , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem with it .
because while they &apos;re busy to make sure they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s misled .
because he led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t deny themselves .
because this person is not interested in evidence of this .
it &apos;s just interested in the need to prove the need to prove that there are <unk> , that there are <unk> .
so in the kind of climate , you see the brilliance of the lie of lie .
and once again , if you have a way to feel this <unk> in other people , you do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember your <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i allowed me to ask me if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and asked me if i wanted to give a talk and my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it fell hard by talking to my idea of my idea .
and i may imagine that i &apos;m trying to imagine you &apos;re trying to imagine you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of all , lots of ideas .
and i took it in the <unk> years , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that &apos;s not what i wanted to do in <unk> .
there &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , right ?
and the back of all the <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
they &apos;re called <unk> .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or <unk> .
but just like the n of <unk> , that kind of a hundred watts from the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> in berlin .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s the word again , because after the <unk> , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word because everything left left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t in the <unk> of the world .
there was a way that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you thought evil .
place of the <unk> , but that was called wind and sun and sun , and i started in the <unk> .
and yeah , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve also been through .
i &apos;ve worked 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s about insanity .
and then i went to <unk> , and then we have become <unk> with friends of the company that then became <unk> with the <unk> of one of the largest <unk> in the world .
and so i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to get too a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively <unk> story , where you could use a memory , where you could use a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a half a thousand people .
they have an renewable number of 15 percent of the time .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any more ?
it &apos;s just technological <unk> .
if you put more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
that &apos;s what i tell you about the politicians when they &apos;re in <unk> with our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already been 20 percent in germany .
but that can &apos;t be a problem for that .
but not , we have seven percent in europe in europe , and our web is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people on this island have been there .
the question was simple , that was <unk> , have the first contacts to start with the island , just expect .
how big it would have to be a battery that you have such an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable renewables .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a hundred <unk> electric performance will be about <unk> <unk> in the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very quickly everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s happening with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re going to be a box of it .
and then it looks like this .
in that run , three of the <unk> , two are always waited by the way .
yes , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on there is the load of load on the ground .
we also have a very precise data of it .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is the rule of a <unk> system , or a system that can only <unk> in small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
petrol is <unk> and the wind , sun , the sun , that they can map the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy a year , not the performance , then you have to turn out the colorado .
that is , at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take the entire net to the net .
and of course , you can only , if you &apos;re in any way , if you &apos;re going to be there in any way .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
this is the little style , so you can also use your <unk> on a little <unk> of a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what did you do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
but if you want to make multiple of these <unk> , and you should build a net , it becomes very complicated .
that &apos;s going to be an energy force , then hydrogen , methane , power to gas you know or sh , or sh , that will be it .
then you have to go to a <unk> and go <unk> and not just make it <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on , because with a normal , <unk> battery .
how far are you going to get the same thing ?
and then you did a whole lot of simulation from the simulation .
these were the first calculations of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the <unk> , when the <unk> five percent goes up a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> of the world .
what would be done to be done ?
have negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
and we were only five people to build one of the society again .
and again , this is the representation .
the brown system is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system is also a <unk> , because we don &apos;t do 20 percent with petrol and not <unk> the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island , meant that we find quite great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can kind of map the electrical conditions of the island of scale to three very three .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for them to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s been <unk> in the &apos; 70s , and then she was developed , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatts performance , and can give six hours long , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of have <unk> <unk> .
and then they put it up .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to turn the <unk> on the net .
and here you can see the whole thing about that .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net of the net .
so here we see this again , again , again , again , the whole one , individual <unk> .
and what we did was , since <unk> was the hall , until today , until today , what was going on between the individual system of electronics to develop software , we made it .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that stands between the subject battery and the theme net and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is that you &apos;re basically in this island , all the <unk> can be able to get the problem that we &apos;re going to raise our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as a moment , is going back to the moment and <unk> , how to go to the island for <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> , then , contributes to <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> of everywhere .
we can start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , because you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent , you can &apos;t make that without memory .
you can go through the n , you can take bed nets , yes , you should do that in every case , but you will never have to get on memory .
and that &apos;s a little bit of the message that &apos;s the message .
so many people come and look at it there , because you can see what problems you get from .
if we turn down the balkans , you don &apos;t have this spinning mass that causes a certain inertia in the web .
and our <unk> <unk> , basically , is just from louder rotating masses of big power , wherever the wave is everywhere around europe .
we look in this web , the fifty hertz , and if it &apos;s nine point nine hertz , we start a few <unk> , then again a little bit of steam , and then we get up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly powerful .
if you go somewhere somewhere , it takes a while to be a while , a while .
the <unk> reserves at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond to other things .
if you don &apos;t have it , this spinning mass , then you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> with this big battery , two milliseconds , of course .
and then you can see what enormous <unk> there are in there .
and the message is , we have to give up this rotating masses , if we just have our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all .
then we have to break down our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> is just called the power station to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> right moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can break the capacity that you can break down the capacity to break out of the net .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies that are a lot of studies .
and then , to this purpose , people go and look at our <unk> , which is basically our <unk> , which is like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of the future .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , right , there &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never been counting , we &apos;ve never been counting .
we &apos;ve got 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to go out in the next 30 years , and have the same capacity to have the same capacity in the world .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to come up .
there &apos;s a whole amount of <unk> and arguments that are going to be a lot of <unk> .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years , that the scientists are asking to my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million <unk> , also to <unk> , now to <unk> the german net , the german net .
this is going to happen in april of april .
so you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from this <unk> to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
and so far , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do these <unk> , which are a little net , which has a little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
but that the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent , from some fossil or <unk> , which will be <unk> somewhere in the world and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re an island .
then they just use what the sun and wind there is where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said they &apos;re using solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in that way , as well as the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can be a collective and a solar energy , and it &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to just encourage you in the sense that you can be a little crazy and can have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty much , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who played on a violin that had only two strings .
nathaniel left juilliard , a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived on the center of los angeles on the center of los angeles .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney <unk> hall in walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> note about yo-yo ford and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers never created into the baseball world , and all of this because of the <unk> passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel were interested in me for <unk> .
i have to mention that nathaniel were turned out a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric electricity and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
and in exactly such a <unk> , nathaniel when we started with our first class in walt disney hall , he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked completely lost in his eyes and worked completely .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison in their sleep .
so i just started playing a little bit of this .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i played , i realized that in <unk> eyes , a complete change was a complete change .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction that was catalyst my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and started listening to hearing some clips from <unk> and asked me to play them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , started by bach about beethoven , carroll , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a <unk> knowledge about music , but with her also , with her own personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i just know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and spoke about music , this was from this <unk> , <unk> man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , great musician .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
<unk> means music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to give him his thoughts and delusions with their imagination and creativity in something .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states of states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing music : so we do something that is in all of us , deep in the inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this expression is all this expression , and it &apos;s inspired , inspired and united states .
so , what he built is the music came back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him who recognized his talent and <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to get music with nathaniel music , whether in walt disney hall , or <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> of <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two of them .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
better , he was grown in <unk> after the expected highest standards of sustainability .
so you could think of it as a result of selling it to it .
i had this beauty of a relationship over several months .
one day , the head of the company , and asked if i could tell in an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this incredible problem for our chefs is , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean as we have beaten down temporary forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction of the world .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed , they &apos;re collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left about it .
so probably or <unk> , <unk> , part of our future is part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you are inefficient , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> in a pound .
not sustainable .
not taste very well .
so here was finally a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of youtube for the company .
let &apos;s don &apos;t have it .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for going out in the sea , you &apos;re not <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
the best in the industry .
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one what ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , short before the event , don &apos;t stop .
i said , &quot; don , what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to be an economist .
well , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a decent answer , until i finally <unk> with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s don &apos;t call it a lot of time .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , fragments and food and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
the assumption is two percent of the time .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> and a <unk> , right ?
that &apos;s me , even though .
no , i actually have <unk> <unk> because , i swear to god who tasted fish after this conversation tasted after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish more .
i ate him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a long journalist was talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s <unk> us in a way .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
hold twice .
in fact , he was still delicious .
who can leave a fish so well after it was going to be <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually he means <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t make the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up on what were basically the wetlands .
they did that by <unk> the country .
they built this complicated consequence of canals , and they kept out of the country and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and downtown it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around this place , which are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company with green the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water to vice versa .
they literally have the lever of the levers .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a 11,000 hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and its company , the ecological destruction completely completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they look out on the horizon that is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and that density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time in front of a long time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , have <unk> to my knees , and <unk> a <unk> .
this is what he takes a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , he sees a pattern of convulsions that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent the largest part of his career in africa .
and i asked him how to become a <unk> , and i asked him to be a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on the relationships of relationships . &quot;
and then it goes down to more of rare birds and algae and funny <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , you know , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with it .
and my head was weak with this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> of the <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do you taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
at the moment , it was as if a director would have a <unk> to have a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner and we offered the most incredible , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet so far the eye .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well , last year , 600,000 birds were on this site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private workers in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network of the world .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and the pinker the belly of the belly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> of it .
oh , and by the way , these <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , you fly 240 miles into the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> , the <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , are you going to fly 240 miles to the farm and fly 240 miles at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i quoted a song from the whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them . i don &apos;t like her <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste of it .
i almost never cook it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted at all .
she liked sweet and pure , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
and i mentioned this to <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge to be a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before it comes to the body .
it &apos;s developed over evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her fish . a farm that makes their success in the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , because the water that comes through this farm comes through this farm from the river <unk> in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are rivers that tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves , the water is clean when it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because when the water is <unk> , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i do it , and you should do that , because this love love , like romantic also , is also <unk> .
you could say that they &apos;re a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , actually taste good .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that the future good food is someone somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest with that .
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we can produce enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- because <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because you have the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years .
feed crops , <unk> on the earth , chicken on fish , chicken on fish , and the whole time has just asked agribusiness , how awful people feed more cheaper , how awful can be ? &quot;
that was the reason . it was the easy business . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call what she is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that allows the fast <unk> capital that allows that production .
this is not an craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the resources , there &apos;s resources .
not through the latest <unk> , not by pumps land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , not by <unk> and nets , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves up ?
or better , how can we create conditions to feed every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never produced something really good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s the ones that are in two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> , <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , trying to restore , rather than <unk> , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the experts who are also experts in the same way .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s me right , because if that &apos;s the future good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so what we see here is a typical <unk> of age , which is a typical age of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a particular cause of cause , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it a lot of the time .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> , people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here over the <unk> .
we can go out and go out and see the data , and see that data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
so if we go back and close to age , we say , 40 years or younger , we see accidents , even the leading cause of the leading is to worry about people .
and who <unk> sees that is true in men , it &apos;s true of men .
so you can see that this is looking at information and data in this way in a living <unk> in a living <unk> .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not even for content itself ?
what we have here are the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which were ever printed in the title of it .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my talk to my career in your suite .
with <unk> , you can dive in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year of life .
you can jump directly to a particular copy of it .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an variable of armstrong , so i click here , and i &apos;ll show you all expenses in which contemporary armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i go back to step back , and the view is the view .
now , i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t look for or not just looking for it .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little bit different from it .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way the way information can be used in the way that information is used .
so i want to go a little bit further with what a little bit crazy with .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single one of them , and they reduce them on a little summary .
the summary contains a short review and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this conventional view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government of the government .
now , after i chose government &apos; government , i realize that the <unk> that are most of the time , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s only to see if you look back a step back and look at the whole thing .
now , in a certain of this summaries , i can go to the subject of time , &quot; people of the year , and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of it are <unk> . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize for a ted prize .
so we can jump and throw a look at all the ted prize for all the ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re on the net the first time as if it &apos;s really a net , not just from side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise that could be a little surprise .
i just &apos;m going to show you the new york times website , right ?
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with every single website like this . we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to step back , and jump directly into a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s important because you just look at the websites in this way in this way that can look at the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain time , in a particular time .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve given to here .
and i can kind of look at what i &apos;ve looked at today , again .
and , if i take a step back and look at everything , i can organize my course after my <unk> , and here , i have to organize after &apos; <unk> &apos; , here after bing , or here to live labs , or here to live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and get you back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes the picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
if we can do this , this will be a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we learn to know , maybe we can even pull out of it .
i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school every day , every day an hour per route .
and my nose always had a book in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds and in <unk> way , my deep in me , voracious curiosity <unk> .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
and it &apos;s always trying to understand the world and understand the limits of possible exploration .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because at the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of miracles that we never could have imagined before .
now , that &apos;s what the <unk> is going to be like in the <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint with it .
and because it wasn &apos;t video games , there were still the whole images in the media media , i had to create the images in my head , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all . if we read a book when children read a book , we took the description of the <unk> in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and painting by aliens , extraterrestrial worlds , robots , <unk> and all this stuff .
in the <unk> , i was caught by the teacher , hidden , hidden , <unk> , <unk> .
creativity had to go out of it .
and something interesting happened . which is interesting to jacques <unk> , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never be able to achieve an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all what i &apos;ve read when i was reading these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become diver down .
the only problem that was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t even leave that to myself .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , found exactly on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years that &apos;s been <unk> , i spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , how we really can &apos;t imagine it .
nature is not aware of nature &apos;s imagination , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity , as ever as ever .
when i was a kid , when i was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew comic books all the time .
so , films were the way to bring images and stories together .
of course , the stories i <unk> from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could get my preference for the <unk> and connect to the filmmaking .
so , basically my two passions are in the <unk> .
something interesting happened to happen in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- , we &apos;ve had <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what came out was the first <unk> <unk> that ever was in a movie .
and he didn &apos;t get money in the movie , he said , &quot; he just played his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> by the magic that went from it .
according to arthur clarke , the law of <unk> technology , and magic is not different from each other .
so they saw something magical about it .
and i found this incredibly exciting thing about that .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really to be involved in the <unk> of the world . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal . the success was all about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money with the movie a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world , a very new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company with my good friend stan swings , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , and she was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was that the phase of analog processes with visual <unk> , etc . , and start to start with digital <unk> .
and then we also did this , and then for a while , this is a competitive advantage .
but in the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we started the company -- too slow , too slow .
but the bar goes back beautiful . and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to create that .
so i moved this and made this other movie about the big ship , which is going to go .
and i sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a <unk> <unk> order , a passionate movie , a passionate movie .
but i didn &apos;t want to <unk> the real <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them , &quot; we go to the train . we go to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
it &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , again , that your imagination can create a reality .
and then we actually created six months later , where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that blew me up .
and the level of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and light and all sorts of things .
and i fell on like this <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more sophisticated to planning with the <unk> .
you go up into this capsule , you go down into this dark , <unk> environment , where you don &apos;t get hope , if you don &apos;t get hope , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same way i would be in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was actually obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part that has curiosity and science . it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give for hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
so that &apos;s what i did , and i wanted more .
and so i met a little bit of an unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as an filmmaker in hollywood and will be <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they explored with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thing .
our purpose was to look at the inside of the ship , which was never been done before .
nobody ever explores the inside of the <unk> . you didn &apos;t have a tools for this , so we developed the technology .
now , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that these <unk> here are pretty similar , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> to the <unk> of the ship .
i actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle of the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
and the set was that a proper copy of the ship of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience , right ?
and she made me realize this <unk> that you use such a <unk> , and so that your consciousness can be in the vehicle in this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a very view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
and after these expeditions , we started what we saw there , for example , to learn , for example , this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and these are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based on sunlight , how we do that .
and so you see animals that right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
and we made documentaries , but actually science , in particular , said , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a child , at the time , and execution in reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot of time .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i think you &apos;re sure a director can also lead to a leader , like a leader or something .
i don &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions to the expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring us any money to get us .
we &apos;re just playing the <unk> , no trace in the way that we &apos;re doing it .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and would have the nails on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience , to a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked on years , sometimes we were two to three months a row on lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have to have a task that you have to explain , because you can &apos;t explain a task that you can &apos;t explain .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; trying to apply the same leadership , which is that you respects his team and you deserve his team and bring it to return .
and it really changed the dynamics of that .
so i stood up with a little team on <unk> terrain . we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
extremely exciting .
an incredible challenge .
and we were working for a half of a half years , and we have a right family .
and so my way changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who said we were really <unk> and transported on the planet , and was transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of that ?
what lessons we learned from that point .
i think first of all , it &apos;s curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me an advice how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry about themselves .
you get other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not alternative . &quot;
but in art , and in study , failure needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
no important endeavor , the innovation has ever been addressed without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks in the world .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is an alternative , fear but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my <unk> at the foundation of the foundation mostly about vaccines and seeds around the things that we need to invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much or little rain . things are going to change how it can &apos;t sustain their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you to get in .
and also , the <unk> is very important to them .
in fact , if you could reduce only one thing , if you could reduce the price , the energy is far from far the most effective .
well , the <unk> is fallen over the time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drove the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we can make modern materials , and we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price in half -- we meet on a new barrier and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 is the planet warms up , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear to us .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the following <unk> , and where their other consequences are , there are some grapes , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re not going to be extremely bad .
i asked the most few times , &quot; do we really have to get down near zero ?
not half the one or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we come close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase the temperature .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than say , we have a <unk> truck that has to go under a three m bridge , which is under a three m bridge , then you can put it underneath .
this is up to down , to zero .
well , we &apos;re going to get a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons every year .
every americans , about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of every on the planet .
and somehow we have to produce changes that reduce that to zero .
it &apos;s just up to the same time .
only different economic changes have ever influenced it , and we have to go through <unk> increase and reduce to a reduction to zero .
so let &apos;s look at each factor , and think about how we get that to zero .
one of these numbers is probably to get one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people live .
and it turns out to be on nine billion to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could probably reduce about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope for 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes everything , the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> , to make these services almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
here we see a very basic service . are there at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , there are many services in the <unk> , there are many services whose energy has a few services to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , 105 taylor : 105 uploaded : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> : <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , is the supply of improvement very much smaller .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a factor of three or maybe a factor of six or maybe a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion on maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this will be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single one of the <unk> for electricity today , renewables and renewables are in the same way that the renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , when i use miracles , i don &apos;t mean the impossible to get the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
and the internet and their services is a miracle .
the people here contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no <unk> that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just going to come next , and some come , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really bring that to the world ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that the idea of people on here ?
and i remembered last year when i took mosquitoes and somehow people liked that .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what i fell with .
i decided that this was my favorite contribution to the environment , to be here in the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies in the world .
you told me they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even leave the glass of the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they all don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or multiple that have an enormous scale and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many directions where people can do that , i really just see five that can afford these big demands .
i have microprocessors , <unk> , fusion and biofuels , out of biofuels .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
who will make it make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard problem for that .
next , <unk> .
and then what do you do with garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that you should work in that way of working with it .
the last three of the five , i put it in .
it &apos;s renewable energy , as often as they are called a lot of time .
and they also -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy energy that these technologies make dramatically less than the power of power .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , a thousand times more than a normal power station .
also , these sources of <unk> are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and as the wind doesn &apos;t go all the time .
so if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way , the energy , even if you &apos;re not available to get available .
so there are a big <unk> here . there are challenges in the transmission , if we say that the source source outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> of it .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 times better than the approaches to time , than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy to do that .
and that happens when you try to get these <unk> sources of land about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the benefit of life .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> to do it , you know .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach to the world ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal of that ?
what we need are a lot of companies that are working on it , hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many who are involved in it .
bill big has several companies , including one called <unk> the great <unk> of the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , in dozens of companies , are doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach is tracking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a time , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea of it .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the <unk> is a lot better , much better than that .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors that are using a <unk> of today .
instead of breaking off the head , they burn it just . a great thing .
so the uranium is used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; traveling wave , &quot; which is called a new wave . &quot;
it really solves the <unk> of it .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like this ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something that is agriculture . hopefully <unk> and cement is clean and cement .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed developed , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note is whether we use the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key feature of this .
when we go back from there , how should the 2020 look look at it ?
and again , it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to get reduction on the way , the less we <unk> , the less we &apos;re going to be the <unk> and also the temperature .
and we have to follow these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure that in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books in this subject .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> energy <unk> , the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed wide , because we need support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that to get together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very interesting wish is that we invent this technology .
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what are the things that do i do ?
we need to use for more research .
if countries do in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous low money that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to control co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to make dialogue and live , and also the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of these investment ?
the hard step is to find the first <unk> , more billions of the <unk> and the place that actually build the first of them .
once the first thing is done , if it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s all very clear , because the performance , the energy density is so different as in <unk> , as we know it .
to understand that right now , that means to build deep into the ground almost like a vertical pillar , and then this consumed the process , and then the process goes up and works on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . so today , you have to go to the reactor , so there are a lot of people who can go wrong . this thing where you can open it up and see things like <unk> or <unk> . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can go to it for 60 years -- think about a column -- you think about a column without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and then it &apos;s done for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that provides a solution to the waste of garbage .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it into the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> with reactors , and that &apos;s our <unk> . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so , what these reactors have a problem is what we fill in ours , and it &apos;s going to reduce dramatically during this process , and it &apos;s going to reduce dramatically during this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked about different people in this world , you &apos;ve been talking about it .
where is the biggest interest , so what really does it get to do ?
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was made of it .
and this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who has done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , time , and probability and probability are really like this in life .
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to produce and then 20 years to use .
this is kind of the <unk> that has shown us the <unk> that we need to <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make that easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , which , as their approaches work , works for their pilots to work for their pilots .
and it would be best when it comes to multiple , because then you could use a mixture of a mixture of it , you know ?
in every case , we need a solution to that .
moore &apos;s big potential , is this the biggest you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would have been the <unk> , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies in the <unk> .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there are the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be a little difficult , but maybe say that about us .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to trigger the <unk> stable to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come into this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much , and what you do ? you might need a heart attack or something like that , you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called the <unk> , which is related to different techniques to <unk> warming , so we had 20 or 30 years longer to give us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> , <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you don &apos;t really want to work on insurance because one that may be lazy , so you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that one is going to save the <unk> .
<unk> : have you one or two sentences for that to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little at the same time .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , that there are a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry about it .
<unk> : well , the actual spend for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
there should be other things that are not suffering .
and you get to big <unk> , and here can be sensible people disagree , if you have something that is not economic , and trying to fund that , for me , most of the waste is most powerful .
it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s a very short one , and it &apos;s only funded to be the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> , only the rich is only the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking about it .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research happen more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to do because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very rare group , and so he now brings it to the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate for appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that is going to be supported by us .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to build the largest largest structure with 20 spaghetti sauce , about 20 billion tape , about a marshmallow and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because people are pushing very quickly to work .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
usually most people start <unk> themselves in the task of the task .
you talk about it , you think it &apos;s going to look at what it looks like , it &apos;s about power .
then you invest a little bit of planning and organization . it &apos;s drawing and put spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in the <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> .
and finally , shortly before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and they &apos;re softly , and they &apos;re moving back to the top , and they admire their work .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s happening that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing will bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more <unk> than others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the best are fresh students of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing to me .
as peter told us not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend time at the head of spaghetti <unk> to be <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason for that to me .
and that was that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
and what &apos;s different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a lot of the opportunity to repair <unk> prototypes .
<unk> can see this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> .
and with every attempt , children immediately get feedback and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance to work with prototypes , central -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are acting .
the average for most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful thing ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to stable structures .
ceos are something about average , but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put an <unk> administrator on the team , they &apos;re going to significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why does that go ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team that <unk> and on the work is going to dramatically improve the performance of the team .
and <unk> skills and <unk> , and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , you get about six , you get about six , the stable structures .
and i tried something exciting to do this .
i thought , we &apos;re going to bring the same thing out .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winner for the winner .
what do you believe was happening with these <unk> ?
what was the result of that ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody built a high construction , he would have been carried at the price of home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> has a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what do you believe happening ?
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
this is the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the same time .
so there &apos;s <unk> lessons for us , the nature of drive and success .
you like to ask , why would someone actually invest in a <unk> to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to make teams of help , cars , video games and video games .
and what the hirshhorn do is , it helps to identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , or kofi annan to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice of this .
and those of you who are interested in , can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , like people optimize the system and <unk> the system .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the most important lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport , which is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all make our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking , like our feelings and our do , in the challenge that lies before us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all about what it needs to us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to give us a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference in it .
thank you .
so , let &apos;s do this as a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now remain .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i often asked my friends in last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or america &apos;s superstar .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re drawn to <unk> , which is <unk> , you know ?
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we have on this planet , health , wealth , mobility , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time before this .
my <unk> died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents kept this number at 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so , there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born in new delhi is to live as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact about that .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox have billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth as it doesn &apos;t have the war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have <unk> , <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us just a generation , hardly even threatened .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to see things , if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in this world go hungry every day to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world &apos;s way .
water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t go from this chaos , we &apos;re not going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that &apos;s going to feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can feed this world with energy that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> , right ?
but this is me awake at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night , we never needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it , as we can do today , as we can do today .
people contain themselves in their faith , and so deeply that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free to free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right to its opinion of progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t right ?
they don &apos;t have right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
and i needed to take a while to figure out what &apos;s going on .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to get resistance to the resistance of what the end of the most effective operation in health care in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically modified food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote about an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were a certain kind of random kind of <unk> in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these jennifer who were crazy were not <unk> at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that &apos;s what i got to mess with .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face this one .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we talk ironic about this with little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand it .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list of the list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they were always right . are they skeptical .
ask , ask them , demand evidence , you demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that this is why we live in an epidemic of fear as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the <unk> with measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
a lot of studies were done to see if that was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing to do .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we believe to see what we really feel .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> that is data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was catastrophic .
in this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which the <unk> are down for measles .
that &apos;s <unk> , and we should be ashamed of that .
it &apos;s awful .
what happens is that we could do that with it .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does someone have measles ?
did one single in the audience ever see someone dying of measles ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
this country doesn &apos;t happen at all , but 160,000 times in the world over the last year .
these are a lot of death by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like jenny like jenny and illiteracy from the platforms like oprah and illiteracy and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation them to the situation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no correlation , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle of this is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he just developed a few other people a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul walking around vaccines and says how valuable they are , and people just stop <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t talk without <unk> <unk> .
he gets calls to home because people like to tell him where they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine about it .
i don &apos;t need it , but vaccines are essential to the same thing .
so , take it back , go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we have measles in this country .
and that &apos;s worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a <unk> of me a few weeks ago , and said , i think i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against <unk> , no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in lagos morning in lagos , and flies right now to los angeles , at the moment , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he will visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to freeze ourselves in lies . we love that .
did you have all your vitamins tomorrow of this morning ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> that helps you to the jumps of it .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we figure out that they &apos;re useless .
the data will show that all the time .
they make their urine . more , they never do it .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you a little bit .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry in the world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system is lying in the way that we do it .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> themselves to us that can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away from , and where do we run ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> of the world .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
none of it -- <unk> , was , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s been .
and you know what ? if i say that , and i say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do what you want ? let &apos;s do what you want .
that &apos;s how they feel good about it . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the <unk> , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to rule the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where believe and magic evidence and science , you get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 to their people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they &apos;ve got them . they always have the same thing .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re right in is this absurd battle between the <unk> of the <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . she has to stop it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , every <unk> , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there were no <unk> in the world .
there were no <unk> . we &apos;ve done all this stuff in the world .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked , and some of them don &apos;t .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more , and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand that much .
we reject the food of food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m always hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is on all this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix this one .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a <unk> , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
these investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s a half a billion people who are eating a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s carrots .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to you is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be a highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so so we do something that we think , i think , not to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; do you want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to be in every case .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can imagine this machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to <unk> , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re happy to have that done .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
a deception is true , because someone knows it &apos;s like this .
so , so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s is in every <unk> for children .
i even learned him from the <unk> magic magic of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it to you .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;ll explain it to him .
so , see what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my own hand .
i push my sleeves back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out out of him , i just will just get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to do anything , as long as i &apos;m here , nothing in my sleeve , or get out of it .
and the goal is very simple to that .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is good , the knife is held through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually very clear to his place that i can shake it without the knife , without the knife .
nothing goes in my sleeves or comes out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often <unk> little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
now , many of you probably know a lot of them in the room .
so he works this way .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
and in the moment , where i &apos;m going to get my hand from you , you see this finger here , my <unk> , just from where it was , in a position where it was so <unk> .
great trick ?
there was somebody sitting back in the back of the way to childhood .
so it &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers change its position .
but it &apos;s actually not that , and then i open my hand , i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held down there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by me , it &apos;s going to be hidden through this movement that the fingers are back again .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and this trick you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> of the world ?
a year ago , i read a study that really blew me out of it .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing to me .
and this is what it turns out : if you offer a placebo against a white pill , in the form of a <unk> pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable pill .
but if you give the shape that you give it to placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color and a letter , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , even though no pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out , right ?
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all that &apos;s yet .
if you take capsules , it &apos;s even more effective than pills of every shape .
a colored capsule that is yellow at a end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
and the dosage is a role for me .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but this is what the key is .
-- that &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s a role for me .
and the shape plays a role of it .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach into the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> substance -- a few <unk> substance that you injected a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector on it , if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill don &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them have really a really pharmaceutical property , it &apos;s just our faith that made a stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something that obviously is a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to a needle when it &apos;s to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long , it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to cut you a little bit a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> special of <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special deal of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and put it through it until it <unk> on the other side .
if you get evil -- if you get out of it -- i showed you a few friends in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman almost <unk> .
so i propose if you &apos;re quickly <unk> , look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part of the back sensitive to the back .
you can see it in the same way , but if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
am i really sorry . does it make that crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side , it &apos;s going to be out of the other .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the <unk> of the world .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> itself the skin , just about us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of that .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right now . &quot;
people in the <unk> are now in the <unk> , right ?
let me show you a little bit about that .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special deal of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can see the <unk> of this .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , look at it , look at it .
okay , let me <unk> a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
and usually i would take the needle a little bit .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds of it .
but i think in this frame here , and with the purpose of a deception , i &apos;m going to just let the needle just go there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re excited about it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have some people the number of books that are published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and they gave a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in the researchers in the researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> about it .
everybody would like to make a happier thing about that .
but despite all these tide of work , there are several cognitive falls that kind of impossible to think about happiness , to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive fall .
these are <unk> , which are about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re so mess as everyone else .
the first of these falls is a <unk> , complexity , to admit that .
it turns out that the word happiness is just not useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
and i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could reduce it , but in the great and all this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a case of experience and memory : basically they &apos;re going to be happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right now .
and then he added really pretty emotional , that &apos;s the whole experience of the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what was destroyed was the memories of the experience of the experience .
he had had the experience of this .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t count because he was a memory of a memory ; memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what that really says is that we could think about us and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt if i &apos;m <unk> you here ? &quot;
or &quot; how was their journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself , and to confuse the two is part of the <unk> of happiness from happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example of this .
there &apos;s an old study for that .
these are real patients that have a painful procedure in a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the detail . it &apos;s not painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they said , &quot; who from two has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question to be done .
patient b has <unk> more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient has a patient b b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient has a much worse <unk> on the <unk> as patient b .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is clear .
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse that was worse , where the pain was at the end , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
in view of the <unk> self , b is clearly an worse time .
that &apos;s going to be suffering , but only a little bit less than before .
so what makes a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory us , and it &apos;s also for the stories that we invent .
and what a story <unk> is changes , significant moments and end .
well , end , very important , and in this case , the end of the end is the end .
well , the <unk> self lives his life continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> of self .
and yet , they get the impression that what we should count in these moments of the <unk> is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in this world .
and how we use it would seem important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
in view of the <unk> self , if you have a holiday and the second week , it &apos;s twice as good as the first , it &apos;s twice as good as the average vacation .
this is how it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , a little bit better than <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories of being added to a new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self , time has very little impact on this story . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remember and tell stories .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories of the world .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self itself , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which is kind of the most powerful self through experience that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> self .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re a holiday that is very often , we &apos;re doing a holiday in the service of the <unk> self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we <unk> from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the <unk> self .
and i probably have about my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now if i &apos;ve opened the folder with 600 images in it , i spent another hour of it .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half a half .
there &apos;s a disagreement that seems to be a dissonance .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment , right ?
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the <unk> all your images , and you get a <unk> drug , so that you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same vacation of the time ?
why we choose the <unk> that we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two kinds of self .
well , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured by the way ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> self over time .
if you ask the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing to be in the <unk> .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives in the world .
it &apos;s how happy or delighted the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different these terms will be the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well-being on the well-being of happiness that make happiness in exactly this way .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the limbic organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the primary lesson that we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty of it .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his favorite self with his favorite self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness of the <unk> is .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the lucky species of self , you will do very different things at the end of the time .
and the conclusion that i &apos;ve said that what i said here is that we don &apos;t really think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term , right ?
well , a second , a different reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you have to think that people in california have to be happier when they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , say , in climate .
well it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end -- some people could at the end to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california to become happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that way .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , how terrible the weather in ohio was , and you &apos;re going to feel that they &apos;re going to have the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we came from a few weeks ago , it gave me a pretty interesting outcome that came from this <unk> survey that came from this <unk> survey .
is that something that you can share with us , because you have a few minutes of it ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect absolutely to find .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the <unk> self .
when we look at how feelings interact with income , they &apos;re <unk> .
and it turns out that under a income between 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under 600,000 dollars in a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly more happy , the poorer they will be .
and we get an absolutely flat line of it .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen that flat lines of land .
what happens is , obviously , that money is a no <unk> , but that lack of money , and we can measure this misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of other self , the <unk> self , they get a different story .
the more money you deserve , you &apos;re happier .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance to have a chance that politicians would take a <unk> like that , and based on politics based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
people are able to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or whether they want to explore , so we have to take this discussion pretty soon .
how to pay happiness is very different depending on how they think and whether they think about the <unk> self or whether they think about the <unk> self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that , i think , in the next one or two decades , is part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , it seems to me , or at least the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games in the world .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to do it as easy to save the world in reality , how they &apos;re to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time with the play larger and <unk> games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week of <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a lot of time when you think how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are almost enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i calculated that they took time at 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes exactly why i think games are so essential to survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you can probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , and <unk> concentration in a really difficult problem .
and if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so much positive that they didn &apos;t know before that was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and when they do it , they shocked them that they &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player is a short victory for a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces around the world , if we take the barriers to the next century , the face of those who are on the edge of a <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad at the <unk> of life .
this is an graffiti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better in play as in play as in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have been doing .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing in reality as well as in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that &apos;s heard about it .
we &apos;re going to do more . i mean , i &apos;m good in the context of motivation , something inspired to do something , inspired by collaboration .
and in reality , if we fail when we collide on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t have them .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that gives the ideal environment to collaborative solving .
and i noticed some things that <unk> victories in <unk> in <unk> .
so first , if you get in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , they have to work . but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and <unk> , and there &apos;s always a very important thing to do with it .
and there are lots of employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life , so that feeling that in a <unk> lot of employees are ready to stand up with a lot of employees .
and also , it &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback system .
they have defined by &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + an <unk> &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence , &quot; which is an intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk and + a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of <unk> how world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to the edge of a <unk> , that we prefer to spend our whole time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> millions of years have spent the virtual problems of <unk> the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing to do .
maybe it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context of <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go upright with the first <unk> .
so the first way in a primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play with play , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of human development , which is extremely extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out that we use this whole time to play all this time on play , actually change what we are as people .
we &apos;re developing in collaborative thinking , very different .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s the truth .
if you look at this interesting statistic that &apos;s recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young man of today in a country with intense <unk> spends 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st of year .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours of the same <unk> that they spend in school from fifth grade -- if you never miss .
so we have a complete <unk> on the young people who learn what it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with an average of any subject to the 21st of year , we &apos;re going to be to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are gamers are <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been given human potential to be available .
so many people in the world are now in the world who spend at least an hour per day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> that save energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , especially in india , especially in india , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players in all the time .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is what these games are doing .
here are the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine the extreme <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do , immediately to do a barrier , with the belief that we have an attempt to succeed hope .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and be the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people more after we played with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that someone spend time with us that the rules will be <unk> that we have the same goal and to stay with the <unk> .
so the <unk> allows the growing of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of that , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of 22 hours <unk> 22 hours a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at work , when if we &apos;re relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings work in optimal terms , when we do hard , we do a great deal of work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of the missions of <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to back the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> in the world .
the second <unk> of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in every other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story about it .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is you believe you can change virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> component .
his work is great . he study why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to see a witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games , i &apos;m something <unk> .
so he says that makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life as in real life .
they can make stronger social bonds as in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i &apos;m just a voice , which is logical to me .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes from an event , the 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> , there were <unk> .
and that was kind of the first of people to develop a lot of people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek <unk> , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were invented , very <unk> , in the kingdom of famine as a famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of <unk> decided to have a crazy idea .
people were fighting . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution to it .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and a national strategy , and a day you would eat . the next day you would play . the next day you would play .
and they would be so fascinating in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat a little bit of food .
and according to <unk> , they survived for 18 years by eating them on a day and ate the next thing .
anyway , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re going to play games to escape the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is in real life , and we get us what we need to play from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end of it .
that &apos;s the exciting one .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better , so the king decided the king , an last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and the winner allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
and they went back to the search for a new home , and they just made so many people back how to survive , and they were looking for the rest after a area where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which was the roman empire , the same dna as the old dna <unk> , has the same dna <unk> .
so scientists recently came to believe that <unk> &apos;s crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that could explain almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could agree with that .
maybe they actually saved their people by play for 18 years by games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about that they learned that they &apos;ve saved all the civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing the <unk> of warcraft .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> , that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;re playing for 16 years of warcraft .
i &apos;m ready to say , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should argue that half of us have spent an hour with play a day until we solved the problems of the real world .
and i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world ? &quot; and that question i have my work in the last years at the institute for the future .
we have this banner in palo alto , it expresses how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best result , and then people make this idea to make this idea in reality .
we take epic wins , and we give people the opportunity to achieve them .
and i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to overcome a <unk> of it .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to go on .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players have <unk> behavior in the game .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to put a greater , more than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute of the future .
where the calculation is , the calculation is that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to sound , we have created almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; of the <unk> , &quot; almost like that .
you know jerry <unk> , where it gives the astronauts , the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , and only together they can save the world .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 of these creative solutions that they can read when they read &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we put on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game , you get the award of social <unk> , &quot; of 2010 . &quot;
we work with universities in all over sub-saharan africa and store to learn social redesign .
we have a comic for this . we have the level high for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
and i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> that benefit from their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end of it .
i want to ask you something about it .
what do you think happened next to the next thing ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have these all superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make close social networks , <unk> and desire to make meaning .
i really hope we play together together to survive on this planet another century , to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like this , and play with me .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things , that we can create every future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the most powerful games of play .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something a few months ago about <unk> wired a few months ago .
i always have my favorite job at writing , but i was working with the text of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which means that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; .
i read to you the post of it .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , i just thought the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s , when i started to build school and started to build my self outside of my family environment and shape , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at that time .
if i would take that post i was born into a world that someone like me as a person , whose life can run positive , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and i expect that i find a <unk> contribution to this , which is what i find here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this room .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better than that .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; are &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words of the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the pronunciation is a big force because what you can do , also , can be <unk> .
so , what do we want to do -- a disabled people , or a powerful people ?
just to call a human being as a child , it could be enough , and it could lead to the idea of ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open up the doors ?
a human who opened for me was my pediatrician was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how you can think that most americans couldn &apos;t point correctly , so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always carried very colorful , and was just created for the work with kids like this .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> , and to my <unk> .
and imagine i had even as a <unk> child with dr. p. , and so trying to stop this practice , <unk> without success .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars , &quot;
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as powerful and powerful young girls , and i could imagine myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> human beings .
this is just an example of many of how adults can support the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the examples of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t make us a room to imagine what we all wish to do : to allow each single one to see themselves as powerful people as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were caused in many cases through a technological change .
so maybe this technological change is more clear that there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every person in society can give something very <unk> and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is , our biggest plus .
but the truth is that we change us . of course we are shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good for the world .
<unk> is not obstacle that we need to be able to get more clear with our lives .
<unk> are just to our lives .
and i &apos;m running <unk> as a shadow of the shadows .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seen , but he &apos;s always with me .
and i don &apos;t want to use the impact , or the heavy of the <unk> of a human being .
there are <unk> in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just real <unk> , and every person is doing it differently , but the question is not whether we come to <unk> or not , but how we come to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that , the people that we love to maintain <unk> , but they also prepare to get clear to it .
and we don &apos;t want to make our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be an medical fact to be amputated , and for other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and necessary disability that i had to put myself apart is that the world always says she could describe me with this definitions .
maybe the whole concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair it for every single one of a larger disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t treat a human society , and not all its forces and possibilities , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a people who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the parts of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s the most important thing between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to <unk> these <unk> times or either , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should go under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the <unk> opportunities .
it may be more about to make sure that we don &apos;t have to overcome <unk> , but that we &apos;re open for it to give them to the <unk> , and maybe even to dance , and maybe even to dance with it .
and maybe we create it as a kind of natural , <unk> and useful and useful , and feel like this doesn &apos;t feel like this .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin wrote about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in something very true in the human character .
i would call it code : not the most powerful of his way , and not the most powerful of its way , but the that can adapt to the best .
in conflicts of creativity , creativity is .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , from the battle of the human mind , is to turn through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of the people .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re going to be <unk> when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of <unk> , a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
we can give us something like this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond severe times from the time .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done is to believe that we should be normal .
again , who &apos;s normal in the world .
there &apos;s no normal one .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really learn this poor person , if you really had to learn ?
i think , don &apos;t .
and conversely , we found that we have people from the members of our society , to be useful , to be useful and to make a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals have 60,000 years ago , and people with heavy physical injuries , and maybe that happened because the experience experience in the <unk> of these people was valuable to society .
they don &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were considered special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there in a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m walking around and see these older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , they &apos;re barely allowed to remember me , &quot;
when i first saw her for the first time , i took her out of the belly of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the way .
and of course , it &apos;s done the click of it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i just knew from stories of my mother about this day because i was , of course , typical to my birthday two weeks too late .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics , my mother was on vacation , and my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had to be the bad news , this alien had to be the bad news .
and he called this part of his favorite <unk> , the potential of the human <unk> .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking of that way .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone to deal with it , is two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you asked me at the age of 15 years , if i had my prostheses against legs and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who opened up doors rather than people to meet me , or to give me an idea of me .
you see , it really takes one people who shows them how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to activate someone &apos;s own , internal forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re going to open up a very good teacher .
they &apos;re bringing them to open doors to open door .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential is <unk> .
again , what potential do we want to draw out of ?
in the &apos; 60s , one case was done in britain , in the state of <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the a student is tested <unk> harder , get the better teachers , etc .
and then they &apos;ve been talking about a <unk> period of students with an &quot; enough &quot; of &quot; very good &quot; -- told them they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote <unk> , and after these three months they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it seemed to be a heart of the heart , that vice versa , they &apos;re just enough to be known as the <unk> of the <unk> .
and it was the same thing for the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had <unk> school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not <unk> to be <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that are the <unk> , and that are the students with the note , and so they taught them something and they treat them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a broken mind that has broken , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more <unk> , early <unk> and our innate ability to imagination of imagination .
but if we can create it to support the human mind , continue to hope , even and other people to find beautiful , curious and more <unk> , we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than they &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said that , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- precise , more and faster and faster .
or want to be more powerful , more force , more force in the world .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who <unk> to more creativity .
which would they like most of them ?
what would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity to me ?
raise your hands . let me see you a little bit about that .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would make a good memory for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to , as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> subject here at the ted conference , but i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s view of the subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology makes no sense except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other <unk> , or is it possible for us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids , there were 20 or 25 different types of hominids .
some are come and went to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were right from the other parts of the tree , but actually the biggest mechanism , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the fundamental mechanisms our cells are .
is you clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> from what comes out of the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think antonio damasio after your self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that you could only want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> of unintended , <unk> push to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria as as they are important for their lives .
they help the <unk> of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be able to be something else -- something that might even adapted to the environment of the environment ?
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just <unk> -- the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a small <unk> .
that &apos;s what we were doing .
this also represents the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , d ace it has fallen to you .
now , when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i made something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue on two <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms came to change , the things started to change .
sexual reproduction starts in the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that &apos;s the rest of the body &apos;s rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of our body is happening in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotions of george burns who las his show in las vegas show his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> , right ?
he opens the door .
in front of him , a beautiful <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the point as a doctor that i was a goal of how the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to keep the body out of the body .
i wanted to keep healthy in the world .
i wanted to restore health to a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life to live .
evolution is all about <unk> of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation to generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to go to the sea .
i think we would all be the mood , the woody allen to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life to prefer .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt the best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
so on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and by the hot steam , if fish were there , it would have made a vacuum , they have a vacuum , they have a <unk> environment for themselves .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move away from that .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons that it was the first thing to get through medicine , has been able to get a lot of genes that would be otherwise , and from the population of the population .
and second , we as a species have us our environment , that we &apos;ve made it that they adapt to us , just and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and encourage us so much that they can &apos;t say longer that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution .
a second way is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed from the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution slow down , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is going to be on as a species far away , it will be isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , amazing and terrifying way .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided from us as a <unk> in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide to be .
so think of it if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make the body genetic adaptation that would heal diseases and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate the reduce of risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do these changes in your genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible to be able to be able to be .
the human genome project started 1990 , and it took 13 years of the time .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone to be available for everyone .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin is produced in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection , but also to be able to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with artists against influenza that have been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future will be much more possible in the future .
so , imagine two other little changes in the way that we do it .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if they could change sperm and <unk> or the fresh <unk> egg to give their kids a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want a healthier child ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow change to prevent disease to prevent disease , could allow us to adopt disease <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have fast <unk> that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by <unk> evolution to the <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even over the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those their grandchildren , or their grandchildren have to deal with it .
do we use these decisions a society that is better , the more successful that is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for other of us ?
are we going to be a society form of <unk> and <unk> , or more effective and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to meet .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in good like in evil , and earlier as you might think , these decisions are going to us to us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one that helps you to go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and get up again .
so at berkeley , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that you put in the morning and gives them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase its speed , for example , to make their balance .
that &apos;s actually the real <unk> of human and machine as a machine .
but not just that -- with them , and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea of it .
to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s made for the request that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help to deal with this problem , to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to a <unk> -- or the human universal of universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design enables it to carry deep to <unk> and carry highly <unk> movements of movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far as we can imagine this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s take a look at the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m very passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate of the world .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , which is in the <unk> of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population that multiplied up by the number of people who are multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years since his , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s been carried by amanda <unk> , who had a <unk> , who has a <unk> , for 19 years , and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is our <unk> , <unk> .
it has sensors .
its completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals , on our <unk> , which is on their back on their back .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as long as their <unk> that they move forward in this pretty <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> , while a <unk> <unk> me to <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after a doctor , and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
and <unk> technologies have been <unk> to learn , to climb , to climb , and even with the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the leaders , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss the <unk> of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i didn &apos;t get the poverty , i <unk> a <unk> in a volunteer , the fire of a volunteer , the fire .
well in our city , in our city , in the volunteers , you have to be pretty early at the <unk> to be able to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire of fire .
i was the second volunteer at the <unk> , so i had a pretty good opportunity to be in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the authorities <unk> and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just a very serious conversation with the <unk> that certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and they stood in the <unk> and barefoot under a screen out in the <unk> , while her house was flames .
the other volunteers who came from front of me -- we call him <unk> luther -- first of all , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> envy .
there was some lawyer or <unk> who could tell the rest of his life that people could tell people that he was in a <unk> house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> me to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up , on the fire , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i got my prey back where i met my <unk> , my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our estimate out to the <unk> , where , not surprising , his much more attention than mine was going to get me to me .
a few weeks later , the <unk> got a letter to the <unk> of her house in the brave use of her house .
one over all measurements : somebody had taken her a few shoes , even a few shoes .
both in my job at robin hood , and also in my <unk> , i &apos;m witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see actions of compassion and the <unk> of individuals and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important to be .
so if i see myself in this room , and people who have ever achieved a <unk> success or on their way there are , i want to offer memory : don &apos;t want to wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until you &apos;ve achieved your first million .
if you have something , you give it a lot of the time .
use them in a <unk> , rooms a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor of this .
not every day , every day to save the life of a people , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so put on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the <unk> of humanity .
a place where women have the <unk> to say sex &quot; hello &apos; , &quot; and the game determines -- where fun is a serious business .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees , fear of big , fear is led to be the <unk> of <unk> females .
and they really came up with this , because this leads to a very <unk> society that has not been seen in deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are at least known under the primates .
they live in the deep <unk> of the <unk> , and the observation is just hard to be accessible to the world .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent struggle for decades and almost so many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction of the bonobos is at risk of bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> , that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a little laugh that the trees was shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know you as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , with <unk> partners and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos is more than the <unk> of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean that way .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
game improves creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections , diversity of connections .
and when you observe bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that we &apos;re doing , which is <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and male in a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts him in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more , not true .
yeah .
so <unk> are spread , both in the bonobos , and with people .
but the game is a <unk> <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes that some are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think exactly how they play ourselves alone , and we &apos;re <unk> limits our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and the unexpected consequences that we form is the real ground of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos us to our past and present the present .
but they also true a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , larger creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> , right ?
to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play .
but are we going to make the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , the lives are not from teeth and claws alone .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , maybe play is on the <unk> .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together together as we play creativity and wonder as we <unk> creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to introduce two couples , middle 1979 , the same day , in exactly the same moment , every baby -- okay .
so two couples , every baby <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the <unk> <unk> is wearing the x chromosome of the egg of the egg .
and in the other case , the <unk> chromosome is an x chromosome on the x chromosome of the egg .
both of them are <unk> , both light .
we come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hats in the world .
under a hat , i do with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a student <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that human body , animal body -- how they thought with <unk> , with <unk> , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i was wearing at my work is the activist as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as kismet lawyer -- from people who are doctors of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have <unk> to ask the social norms in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who have not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> of it .
<unk> comes from many different forms of forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not the male or female standard of the male or female standard .
in a case , maybe someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> that we all have a stage , to grow testicles .
and so the testicles on the stadium are testosterone to testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> , <unk> .
so , a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
and as a consequence , the body has more of the typical female course of the typical female .
if the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it usually takes the puberty until they get puberty and their breasts , but they &apos;re not going to get their period , until someone comes to it that is something different .
and you make a few tests and find out that it &apos;s rather than <unk> and uterus , in fact , and that you have an y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually keep this person for the male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called <unk> in our bodies , which is called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> represent what <unk> hormones are .
most women , as i -- i think -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> -- but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be spread over the whole range .
he had an extreme form of an innate form of <unk> .
it has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong that they basically have a male <unk> , which is basically a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , its <unk> male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he saw a boy -- no one knew something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was internal , that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation in <unk> that &apos;s been <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something called <unk> , is called <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
gender can occur in many different varieties of different variants .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- be <unk> or <unk> , was <unk> -- by surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because this is their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often made different kinds of surgical interventions because they threaten our social categories .
and typically our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomic characteristic is linked to a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman means to have a female identity ; a black person means to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this awful <unk> idea of it .
and when we face with a body that is actually something very different , it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture , which is a lot of romantic ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
where i had seen most of the time , the <unk> was <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender was asked by the <unk> world bank in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me with the question : &quot; what test you &apos;re going to do that tells us whether <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test in that way .
and we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female and female and <unk> and female and <unk> , we are the line as of course .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our <unk> in the world .
in our view , we get into all sorts of <unk> areas of the world .
for example , we &apos;re running on the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them to a few <unk> of <unk> ?
while we continue to move our science further , we get increasingly into a zone of the <unk> where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we had probably too simple .
we see this in all kinds of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle about the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what point a body to people , so that he has another right than fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight when someone was dead .
they only kept a feather under the nose , and when she moved , they haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if they didn &apos;t move it , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we take people <unk> organs , and they want to put them in other people &apos;s other people .
and as a result , we got to the battle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really hard situation where we don &apos;t have so simple categories as even as used .
now they could assume that the whole system of categories would really make me happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , makes me tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to take a big fan of the <unk> , i &apos;m a big fan of the <unk> .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , where they did that i did all the few years to look at the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> has happened with the <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> were in my view of the original <unk> activists , so that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and they were using it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us was significant to us .
as you all remember , our <unk> the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the proton .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have these political power because of the <unk> for the father and so on .
the <unk> meadows this idea back and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were created the same time .
they <unk> the field , and decided that <unk> , the common count , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this , because they were part of a <unk> system in the two things that were together in the two things .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up with the science .
if you look at the history of the <unk> , many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations <unk> , and meadows things , like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of power is based on a very <unk> of birthright .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they did a concept that was <unk> in the <unk> .
and so they &apos;re prepared to be the future movement of the future civil movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years of that ?
and women are successful at success .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin color that are <unk> differences in anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start to question why we &apos;re sustain certain <unk> .
well , mind , i want to sustain certain of the <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish in the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy of the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to give their informed consent or to marry them .
so there are some anatomic speakers that make sense of me , and that we think , i think , i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been <unk> to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , in the same day of 1979 .
so let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months of <unk> , so she was born on june 1980 , so she &apos;s born on june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born to <unk> , so he was born on one march in march .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months of <unk> , they have all sorts of right three months ago -- the right <unk> sex , the right to choose to drink the right thing .
heinrich has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we find other kinds of <unk> about what their rights are .
heinrich , because i think he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with <unk> -- because you assume he &apos;s male , he can now be moved , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
so maria , not in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same thing that heinrich in all states , and to marry it right to marry it .
heinrich can marry a woman , but maria can marry a woman today in a few states today .
so we have this permanent <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways , problematic and questionable .
and for me , what are the question : what are we going to do , because our science is making progress in the realm of anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy that could be based on anatomy , could be applied to anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is autonomous .
so where do we go from that ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we have to pull somewhere a line , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position of the way .
so for example , texas , at a point , has decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and marry a woman to marry a y chromosome .
now people don &apos;t test people in practice of their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> of the <unk> .
if we look at one of the <unk> of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream talk to a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t do people to &quot; their skin , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea of it . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you look at people because of their <unk> ?
i want to suggest that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions to make their sexual relationships than some <unk> that i know .
so how should we <unk> the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out , it &apos;s really hard to do that .
and part of me , what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be in the future -- could it be made in the future -- by the fmri , by the fmri ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make sense of democracy .
in our effort to democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing right now , and i think we would make our thing in the future .
and states of these species don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke a few years ago who had <unk> to separate them , partly to make a name .
and i said , &quot; well , do you think about political asylum , rather than separate the surgery of it ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be that they &apos;re without to change the state of the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities like democracy , or looked at if we had the mothers to have more involved in it .
and i want to say something that a feminist is radical , and that i think there are different kinds of insights that run from different kinds of anatomy from different kinds of anatomy , when people are applying a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- more complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i did a graduate student , i asked one of my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so i looked at me as a feminist question -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i ever heard about .
feminism is about stereotypes about gender , so nothing female is nothing female about gender .
but the more i thought about his question , so more , i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is to say it could be something , average , which is female brains from male , which makes us feel more important for <unk> social relationships , and helps to worry about it for the <unk> .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we get democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body thinking about what identity , and thinking more about relationships .
so if we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find a different opportunity to find a different <unk> , crazy outfit , and to blog and blog recently .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also on my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars serve for usually a good purpose ; i see quite unique ; and it makes to my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size , right ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;m filled with for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what do someone bring with so many <unk> of this ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought up with .
i brought seven some <unk> , and that &apos;s all i &apos;ve got to do with it .
<unk> for exactly a week are everything i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet i had anything else i wanted to wear , if i came to palm springs .
and because you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who &apos;s here at ted in your underwear -- that means i found a few things .
and i want to show you my favorite for this week , for this week .
sounds that good ?
as i do , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons i believe whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> , to have nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has me 55 cost , and it was the most expensive piece i took in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people in the world .
tuesday : adaptation &apos;s going to be totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time of my life trying to be myself , and adapt me at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surround with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to estimate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like i got dressed , or i remember her seven-year-olds .
and i like to smile , &quot; thank you very much . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key thing .
if you think you &apos;re in something good , it &apos;s almost safe that you &apos;re doing with it .
and if you think you &apos;re not good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you a little bit .
if you believe that inside and the outside is a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing they can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want to .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about one , without telling a word .
it was always shown me and over again when people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this to everything again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotionally , because the corner is going to be a different crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait for me , if i have a little bit of love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something here i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
so a time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
this would call them in <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start to appear in our lives .
our cities were in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become the computer in free .
and as computers in free , they start to react in other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
when we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and beyond the cities , all this perceive and power in the objects of daily life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo &apos;s dream of <unk> .
well , today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of the concept and power to perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to show you is in truth one of the first of our labs .
it was a four years ago in italy .
summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the <unk> of it .
some of you will remember , it was when italy played in france , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy has won on the end .
now you see what happened in this day , just at the watch of activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city of the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline , the timeline .
in the afternoon , people here and there , the calls made and move out of it .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway to the door .
<unk> , people make a short call , go on the toilet , which is the toilet .
second , <unk> . end of normal , <unk> .
first , long , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> , <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big essence of it .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all went down to that .
you see the picture of the space <unk> , where , since the roman time that people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and they see the essence at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way , as we couldn &apos;t .
again , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but things that we use and consume .
well , we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is how they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where things go from .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to pursue the waste while it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we started , something more than a year , in seattle to tag the things that they can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the little brands , and started tracking him .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got to get out of here .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> and more complicated things about it .
the other thing is that we believe that if we see that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away , it &apos;s not just somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re going to throw on every day is the same thing .
and if we want to show that people , we can push change change in behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition in public places as part of the architecture of architecture as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that was in a <unk> was , imagine these tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves , valves , valves that open and close .
it &apos;s what &apos;s like a <unk> with <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text , text .
and you can come to it , and it &apos;s going to open up to let you see how you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> to the mayor .
it &apos;s a very <unk> way of that .
and we got the mission to design a building on the expo .
we called it the digital water system .
the whole building was out of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open and make it in it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
so here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s happening inside inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not going to get wet .
well , i should tell you what happened one night when all of sensors stopped working in the night of all sensors .
but actually , it was a more fun thing in this night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections of it .
and this is what it brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that <unk> could really start to fly the same thing in the world .
imagine you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and each of them with a little bit of a <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter as the ones you saw earlier , in perfect synchrony , in perfect synchrony .
you can have this cloud of it .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but in three dimensions where what changes is the light , not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different kinds of things .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different ways , in different <unk> .
but then all this could be a 3d cloud of <unk> , where you can move through and move through that they can look through many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to shape a <unk> v , like a <unk> v .
if you turn the light , it looks like this , so as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people is controlled by it .
it could have a impulse that has a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something first of all the time .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse for the <unk> .
here you can see <unk> dance .
on the left side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
so you can understand the whole movement of the world .
you can do that all the time in the time .
but then , if we all have <unk> , they can play with it and play with color motion and play <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics for the olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud , the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we have to engage the people to do something and change the environment -- almost as something we call it <unk> how to move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation to a <unk> of a <unk> .
and i think that the remarkable one of what happened last years , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical into a digital world .
that has digitized everything , and makes it available through the internet .
today , we can see for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed -- can be done by the digital world , from the <unk> forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol of it .
that &apos;s built in the city of something like this .
but tomorrow , it can to ask us to ask the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical physical .
so the idea is that we actually have the people in which they do things together , collective do .
the cloud is a cloud of <unk> , in the same way as a real cloud of particles , a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical shape in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
they can move into the inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see them from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more than kind of using the connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to , like london new <unk> .
you can go to it .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important to me .
through my work , i try to express that people not from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
<unk> me .
my heart sped up , and i was trying to make what i was trying to do with me .
the <unk> around me <unk> almost 60 meters from the water , and i just could wonder that this was a snowflake on a other snowflake year after year .
<unk> is born as a calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with their environment , with their environment , and their experiences of their experience .
some barriers are to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t move more and more passion in a seizure of dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we see people often see us .
but the truth is far away from that .
as a iceberg , i get a <unk> atmosphere , which is a <unk> atmosphere .
it melts during the iceberg , it feeds <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life .
i go to my photographs of this <unk> , when i do portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments from this individual moments , and never again .
it &apos;s not death when it melts ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m very young -- a thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i want to show you , show a iceberg that i have in greenland in greenland in greenland .
very rare , you actually will see a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat in the world .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
please look at the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> of the iceberg .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters of the time .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on is about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> in the &apos; 80s .
then , one day he came back from running , and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it as well .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can just use his eyes to be a little bit .
i stood up with him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art art and look at .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
and i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
and i want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all communicate paralyzed by these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard the higher <unk> and have remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
anybody seen the movie &quot; butterfly and <unk> , &quot; ?
so you communicate -- that &apos;s how your fingers go down .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just a check , and instead i asked a check that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i should <unk> him .
because it &apos;s an farce that someone who &apos;s still carrying it can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
so i spoke to a conference for a few months later .
and i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw with a <unk> that can only see the negative area .
so they &apos;re moving around and make <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are shown there are a life cycle of life .
it starts with the pipe , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally , people actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance to <unk> the doors , and actually they actually get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do that , and that we were <unk> and all pictures on the walls would be <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description of that .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , and we have a device that is available , and now we have a device that is free -- you can build it yourself , we can build the code for free , the software can download for free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
no insurance can &apos;t be <unk> .
not a hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw on his eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this <unk> in front of the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony took for the first time to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we prefer his bed , so it can see out of it .
we put a projector on a wall of the <unk> in front of the hospital .
and he drew back for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
so we had to go into the parking lot , so we felt that we felt a part of the <unk> , so we felt a part of the <unk> .
at the end of the end , he sent us an email with the following content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i was drawn to something .
i feel that i was pushed under water , and finally , someone went down down and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our <unk> , <unk> .
and that holds us on the shelf , and it &apos;s always going to go to us .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes to a <unk> of the same thing .
and someone who has a <unk> potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition of the same thing .
we won a few awards out there .
think it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it to it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets of mine .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has honored us when one of the 50 new inventions of 2010 , which was really great .
and the <unk> is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that there &apos;s this april , at the <unk> <unk> in the city of los angeles , called &quot; kind of the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
and there are probably the hardest representative of the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty scary .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it , then it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible , eventually impossible .
make it possible -- you all have here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never had something to do with <unk> , but i just have something taken around me with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , and that question to every single day that you have to see something that has to be done , if not now , when ? and if not me , and if not me , then who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and it &apos;s probably america &apos;s mostly <unk> of <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want a scientist to come out of this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go around the block , and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle of a circle .
one of my friends , it made -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the <unk> green and blue to save my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the <unk> .
in general , they did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed me to san francisco -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s in <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man that i know you &apos;ve found him have found him now .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to live . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took us around them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn me as adults , they turned into a box of it , turned into my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i &apos;ve talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything to the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
it needs to -- it would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion of the while , as you come up with 1,000 meters .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds fear of it .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> of the <unk> .
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine already <unk> , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it converts the rockets .
so imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard of .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> of the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror to the end of it .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
and as i thought about it later , a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is far as far , and the person is there , i open it up , and then i open it up .
i never want to move a little bit of the life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we were the george washington bridge , so pretty about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego of my ego .
and i <unk> the time that i <unk> for <unk> things with people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better than that .
i didn &apos;t have to <unk> with my wife &apos;s two years .
it feels great to be the same thing .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and the inner clock <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water in the <unk> .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts of the way you know it from documentaries .
while we cut , i had this feeling , man , to die is not terrifying .
almost like that , we would prepare for our lives for us .
but it was very sad to do that .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really <unk> in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my children growing up with me .
about a month after a month , i visited a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent .
no time .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little child .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
and i realized that by the time , i &apos;ve been working on the dots that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i was the miracle of that day to die in this day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to all that today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change , and how would you change ?
what would you do that they check , because you think they would be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is pretty simple to be a little bit of that .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there is nuclear weapons , the <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here are <unk> , which is <unk> .
so if we can do the systems to <unk> the systems that control <unk> and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> box to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning of <unk> .
so we &apos;re going to start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will <unk> into the gray box , the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> , and the iranian <unk> <unk> -- commission .
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research , six months ago , we started to be unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of this <unk> , which was the purpose of this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which in terms of the most powerful part , the most powerful part , he made by a lot of <unk> controlled failures .
and it seemed something <unk> , with these gray boxes , these <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
this is our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we used our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something funny happened to us .
as a <unk> , our cheese didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we experimented with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a <unk> attack .
completely on a certain goal of that .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to get it on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , then don &apos;t do anything about it .
so , that was really my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , say , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is to be a little bit about .
so , <unk> and we <unk> the <unk> code , and found that he &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional , from people who had obviously available all the <unk> information .
they knew all bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
they probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> .
so they knew all the time .
and if you &apos;ve noticed that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code of code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code that we &apos;re talking about .
looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we &apos;re able to become smart from this code .
so after first , what we were looking for was <unk> <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and trying to connect this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or to disprove .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves a <unk> goal , it has to act around a <unk> goal , and very likely it is in iran , because there were most infections in iran because there were most infections .
well , there &apos;s not several thousand goals in this area .
and basically , it &apos;s on the <unk> nuclear power plant , and on the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me give a list of all experts for <unk> and power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and i <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise what we had in code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor down , and eventually even to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it &apos;s slow to let &apos;s get it slowly -- obviously in trying to get <unk> despair so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to get fast behind it .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse by the fact that we looked at very carefully data and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> goes out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started thinking about scientific literature , about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they &apos;re <unk> in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it &apos;s got better than that .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 so-called levels of levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> , right ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that fit in really good time .
and this gave us big confidence for that that we looked at here .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that way .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a dead and to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually in fact on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
and the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and then the rotors and slowed them down and slowed it down and down with six <unk> in interaction and manipulated the valves .
so , in large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have defined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> that way .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by the <unk> of <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really <unk> me out of my socks .
down there is the gray box , and on top of it , you see the <unk> of it .
now , what this thing is is that it &apos;s the forces of sensors -- so for example , of <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides <unk> code that &apos;s still during attack the attack , and it &apos;s run by wrong forces .
and in fact , this false forces are taken data from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> are fed by the <unk> , which is fed by <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
and the idea of this is obviously not just to <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> .
it &apos;s actually much dangerous and more dangerous than it is .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> of the world .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough to react to it .
so for example , in a power station , if the large <unk> is too fast , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and not the <unk> , the <unk> will notice it &apos;s going to notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i say now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , he would work very well -- in a power station or in a power station , or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> stick on a <unk> stick , as we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology in the spread of it .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> of it .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to do .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we have to ask the consequences , and we start preparing better for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much told that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s involved in the <unk> , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the most profound superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- happiness , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for a <unk> . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years that spent me in situations that are usually very difficult and kind of dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard to me .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i shot in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing than this to eat -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
so when i knew that i would come here to look here in a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i put an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the possibility to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk 2011 .
but it &apos;s a very good media , it &apos;s a very good media to do it .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of a lot .
this is just the <unk> , by the way .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> of the world .
now if you had asked me a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with you .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i went to some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be ready to go to anything so hard and as dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is , what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , with the whole film through <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; called the <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> is that everything , from top to the end , from the beginning to the end , just with brands -- from the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center of ...
these people are going to be connected to the film -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , for always ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to cover .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you ever have .
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the greatest drink of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show you that brands are part of life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy when <unk> would help to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use the perspective , because that has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop that ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it to every case , some really famous brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we might see a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing because of the film or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both right .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do it with it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
think of the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out it was actually , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
i was amazed by that .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , to present your product so many people like possible , so many people like possible .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media media -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting <unk> that the masses will bring this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake of that .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been fine .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you look at transparency in the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; characterized by <unk> and access to information , especially what <unk> in terms -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a lot of transparency , right ?
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it &apos;s about the ceo of it .
but if it comes to the fact that it &apos;s done , something changes , it changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is there to be a risky player ?
a whole dish is cool by food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see when i was a kid , and my father was sitting to lie -- and he &apos;s sitting , he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in every history of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version of it . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem is a broad problem .
i have friends who do big , huge <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> as i do .
and my friends , the big , huge <unk> , say that the reason why their movies are so successful is so successful in the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends say that little <unk> , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to ban ban in the movie ?
always , if i do go on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see ban <unk> .
and every time i <unk> someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so far ? you see a little nervous of it .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview in the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to both be equipped for men , <unk> , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> socket .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a brand of a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so making things -- you know , remember , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
in what words would they describe to ban them ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question to be .
<unk> technology , <unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something under the <unk> that someone else does .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes to something positive , unlike &quot; fight odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect of the world .
and this is a <unk> thing .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , like me , <unk> .
you should tell me about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
<unk> , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really make beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s , <unk> <unk> on <unk> , except on the <unk> .
well , what is the brand of <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of <unk> and so a stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like sunglasses , or a jewelry , and this stuff .
if dan was a brand , he probably would be a classic mercedes <unk> .
so , man two : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman , part of <unk> , part of part <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> of it .
i sell <unk> in the entire country , in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand that &apos;s been my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were <unk> .
man five : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> of the world .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for that , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how to connected with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview in the worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world you live in -- like people around one , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s how i want to be a little bit of this .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about why &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what brings you ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you in the right way ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what does the red look like ?
tell me a little bit about this part of this .
a little bit more about them , that &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing .
what other <unk> did you go through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be fear . in what kind of rollercoaster are you going to be , is it ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well , good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be .
there was a lot of crazy things about it .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> two separate , but it has <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
they &apos;re very good at that .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction in it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
what other brands do of action ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii mini of mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things coming and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe their <unk> , your <unk> , how would you ?
you have a <unk> ? are you something that makes blood in <unk> ?
or are they more likely to be a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little quiet , <unk> , conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , failing and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , magical and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> , right ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> is the same thing .
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and <unk> and said no , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using today , to be the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertising as well as films as well as films .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned by the way .
in the city , for five years , no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school school in school in school , in all these places in the impoverished schools , in all of america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got for most feedback , where i had the biggest success , are where i put things directly with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
and i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , that people challenges that our view of the world is challenging .
and how was that for you ? what it was ?
well , because the movie was written at the <unk> film festival , we can look at this .
and according to january , it was only in january , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
this is actually just a period of two two / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not <unk> yet .
there &apos;s no even online . no <unk> whatsoever .
it &apos;s not out in other countries .
well , finally , the movie has a very big momentum of the movie .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , at almost every <unk> that we talked about , to make their clients , to make the fingers of it .
and something that i think is that if you take your chance to pull your opportunity down , you make risks in these risks .
i think if you prevent people from it , you get closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit on a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks , to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be <unk> with .
finally , we should welcome the fear of being welcome to the <unk> .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
a big taste full of , we &apos;re welcome the risk of taking the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty is very far .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they welcome transparency to me from my good friends of <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> for ebay for ebay .
big data is turned into the world in big opportunities for organizations around the world .
<unk> <unk> : welcome to transparency
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s going on with the $ $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question to be .
i have a check in my pocket , just on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check from dollars to fund my favorite year in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i went to do something with museums and art , my favorite , which is today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and explaining access to this slide .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education -- i didn &apos;t go -- but i had many museums , and i had no access to many museums and this artwork .
when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot to learn .
and while i worked for google , i tried this desire -- art accessible -- to make technology together with technology .
and then we started a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to go to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums in these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
you go around and affection .
you want to be <unk> in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in the inside , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just on . a lot of fun .
look for it .
thank you , but the best thing is that .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it , it click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click it now .
this is one of the images we introduced with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you &apos;re looking at something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they want to really sit in .
and so i started playing around , and realized that there &apos;s something in front of it .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to , and i realized that these kids actually beat something to actually beat a little bit of it .
i was a little bit , talking to some familiar at the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is beaten a goose on a stick with a stick .
apparently , it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you an overview of what you get out of what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
in the previous example , it went to find detail of detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> of the world ?
and what if you want to see van gogh how van gogh create this masterpiece ?
you go in . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite features , until i &apos;m really immersed in the humility .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function of it .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time to be the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections of collections .
each of you , everybody -- just whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and create your own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection of your own collection .
just , they go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can take all of your friends , send your friends , and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums to come out of the museums .
i may not tell you about that .
they come from artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent properly online .
and the biggest question that &apos;s been asked me was , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to add the experience of that .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about , thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be <unk> in two camps .
that &apos;s the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half that is the intuitive side of it .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , that would be completely logical to be in the <unk> , right ?
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive to be in .
now , where would you position your brain at that scale ?
some of us may have been for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high school that is in both <unk> in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
they can be intuitive and intuitive .
and so i look as one of the people , with most other experimental <unk> that have a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they make the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over years is probably that one thing can be at the same time .
i mean , it can look strange to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a child playing on a <unk> of a <unk> .
he was a toddler , and not very good at it , and he fell down all the time .
but i bet that he taught him a very valuable lesson with the <unk> , which is the great things you don &apos;t just get over and stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a <unk> in the world .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed to describe quantum mechanics to describe tiny particles .
but they didn &apos;t need to describe the great mundane objects around us , which is the way to describe it .
and that didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe only because i don &apos;t play with particles as often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them out of it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle with the same thing .
but my logical side , it doesn &apos;t really have liked the way .
because if all things are made of particles , all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should be like this , right ?
so i would be able to feel better with the whole thing , if we could kind of show that <unk> , the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , a few years ago .
i created one of them .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip in the world .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;m going to push it up here . we look at exactly here in the center of this .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , it &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it stands over the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing a similar way to make a computer chip , which is a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool hole and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy to you in the world .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people , and i hear them don &apos;t want to do it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
quantum mechanics , so that <unk> objects are just the same thing .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people , but the light that seems to it and the wind that seems to you over and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see this piece of metal , this piece of metal acts , we had to go out all the way out of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did with it .
we took the light off , and we put it into a vacuum , and it <unk> all the air , and it was the elevator to almost the elevator , was the piece of metal to behave as it wanted to behave .
so we measured the movement of it .
we found that it &apos;s really strange to get a little bit of that .
instead of just sitting there , it &apos;s a <unk> , the way it was like this -- like this -- like this -- how a <unk> and together <unk> <unk> .
where we gave him a little push , we could vibrate it up at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allows only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms out of that piece are silent , and at the same time , same atoms are moving and down .
just precise , they agree with it in the <unk> .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different places , which is the same piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth it for all this year in the clean space , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece is about the difference between the piece between metal and them .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal can be , why don &apos;t you also be ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says is .
so , imagine you would be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness figure out that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like , as all the objects in the elevator are only <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small space together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics is that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s more deeper than that .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they want to live and work , the possibility is to pick up between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition about new inhabitants .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world that are not even a single city that they would welcome to be welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them to build .
so we could just have the world with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but let &apos;s just share the building of homes against cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , that they didn &apos;t do that .
you could try to extend the capacity of the existing apartments to the ground .
but you know what you would be to get into these homes and your environment , and your environment to avoid rhythm and <unk> .
so it turns out , it &apos;s very hard to keep all these increments of these profiles .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new block , as the laws there would be there to support a building and not defend it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments create new surfaces that offer enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
and later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform of reform in <unk> .
in 2009 , in the summer of <unk> , under a severe <unk> .
the next <unk> elections , won <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , whose program new and new , as <unk> promised .
he asked <unk> to become his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared a talk to tedglobal at tedglobal .
so through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city to the basic elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t disturb existing <unk> .
we pay new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and they &apos;re usually laws that were back to us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk to the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him <unk> .
the two names called me the same thing .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in miami , in december of a hotel .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , think about that , that a area in some cases per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a pause , i said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so i was asked by the president of <unk> , who meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is going to move forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> and keep a talk at the fourth and fifth january of a talk .
so i &apos;ve given another with facts , which is a graph like this , which has to have a graph like this , that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city denver , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in denver .
alone , one area of 100 <unk> has been a area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince you if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area from at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres of it .
polite have all the <unk> .
the audience in the audience were very serious and attention to the world .
the head of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city gives people new opportunities to people &apos;s new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in <unk> , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
we &apos;ve driven in an area of time .
this is from this place to this place .
it makes slightly thousand square miles .
and shortly after , on the 19th of january , you have congress to have a change of the constitution to have a <unk> control that is special for special <unk> .
in a country that has just a violent crisis behind , congress was elected to a voice with <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it has to be authorized twice by congress .
on february 17th , it became approved for a voice to a voice of <unk> , for the second time .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> in the world that was most interested in most of the world , which was most interested in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new center that built in south korea , <unk> big than the urban <unk> .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there were two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you look at it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> , and they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already going to work on a legal system that <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also going to work on a external legal system .
a country has already offered his supreme court as a dish for the <unk> calling the <unk> system .
and <unk> , and <unk> are very interested in it .
they even get funding with it .
one thing you already know was , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> about it .
there are many companies who like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say they like to live in a different place in a different place .
a million people left latin america and go back into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to get their families to go to work , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to earn enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes kids who try to find their parents that they have , in some cases , since a decade ago .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about it in <unk> a completely new city of life ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of around the world , or hundreds of over the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new inhabitants ?
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from <unk> have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i took a survey recently with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical american is a typical american is 70 .
and also , recently a study of ceos were made for a week for the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with these ceo , and how much time they engage with making decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo in the week has done with <unk> tasks .
each of these topics was , of course , from many , many smaller decisions , of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions about it .
do you know how many decisions you have in the nine minutes of the meeting , in the hour of an hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re going to do to deal with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions to the solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hand because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i urge you to ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question is : are you willing to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a ph.d. at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> store ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> of it .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> , right ?
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drink <unk> .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how do you never <unk> anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from thousands of old <unk> <unk> .
so i decided to go visit one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model you really offer people all these options ? &quot;
and he showed on the <unk> of tourists that came up every day and usually their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang of affairs .
they had different kinds of <unk> , <unk> .
we put a little <unk> on the entrance to the <unk> of the <unk> .
we have six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we have two things : first , i &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would say more people are still standing and <unk> ?
there are more people standing there when it was 24 , about 60 percent , than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people bought a glass of the glass to a glass of time .
now we saw the opposite effect of it .
and from the people who stayed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of glass .
and from the people who stayed there when it was six , well , we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of people , who they had six times when they had six to choice .
now , to buy a glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our hip -- but it turns out that it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that it affects us in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even when it comes against our own best interests , it &apos;s about our own interests .
so the day of the day : save financial , <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we make decisions for almost a million americans from almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> who were a <unk> can be possible , the <unk> plan , the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context in fact , in fact , in fact , the way .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , that , in fact , participation was lower .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered two fund , a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost 60 fund offered , the <unk> now fell on about the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you were to participate in the choice of choice , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the people who decided that the more possibilities are available , the more avoid they pick it up and fund it and fund it .
the more ways they were available to them , the more they put their entire money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions are heard to the decisions that someone would recommend when their future resource is important to us .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that provide more and more choices to make more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push it up , even when it comes to their own best interest in their own interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial , worse health and worse medical decisions .
they decide more for things that they make less satisfied , even if they make objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we actually can &apos;t go to the comparison and can be able to vote and choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and in different ways -- that they can just apply in your business .
first , limited to the first .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less is more .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; reduce . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different head and <unk> species of 26 to 15 degrees , they &apos;ve experienced 10 percent of the sales to 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 at the worst <unk> <unk> , they experienced that the profit at 87 percent -- a result of both the sales of the sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , offers 45,000 products .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products to you today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which today is <unk> supermarket in the world , and they only offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce -- a kind of tomato sauce .
every single harvard employees , automatically , is automatically part of a <unk> part of it .
those who really want to meet a selection will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to reduce it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities for that . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
well before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said he &apos;d be ready to offer all the people in this audience to offer a <unk> vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read you that .
and now i give you a few seconds to read them , and then i urge you to clap , if you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s supply of the offer .
are that all the time ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands in the world .
all right .
in fact , that &apos;s the first time you had more information , when the second time , but i would be able to guess that they felt it was the second time in the second time .
because the images made it real for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between opportunity to understand what consequences with the individual possibilities are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences have to feel vivid and concrete .
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more than 30 percent , if you use a credit card or a credit card , than a cash card , as in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel we &apos;re going to feel money .
and it turns out that if you create it that something feels a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting just as she was always , we &apos;ve added a little bit of something .
the little thing that we have to do was that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives when they were going to save money .
third technology : <unk> .
we can do better categories than more choices than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve made in a <unk> basis .
it turns out it &apos;s in the <unk> supermarkets , and down at the northeast area , the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of <unk> .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left ad is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap into hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories need to say something that makes choices , not that choice is available .
and this problem , you often see , if you look at the long lists all this fund .
who do you really want to inform ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to get rid of complexity .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car , completely <unk> .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car .
now these decisions are in the number of choices that they offer a decision to make a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the order in which they seem to make decisions .
half of the customers go from many possibilities , 56 <unk> , to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers are from low possibilities , four gears , to 56 , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how are they interested in that .
if you use the power of the decision , that means that you &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i lose you .
what you find is that the people who are coming from many to the low <unk> will go and choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is going to be present .
so when i start with the simple , i learn how to <unk> .
even though the gears choose to choose me , nothing about my preferences in the interior , it still makes me choose to choose it .
it also puts me in excitement about the big product that i &apos;m going to <unk> , and so i &apos;m ready to be able to make interest in this .
let me summarize .
and i told you about four techniques that the problem of <unk> -- just -- will go to the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; organize -- we can do better categories with more categories , less possibilities for complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people they offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re choosing to the choice of choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> in youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> , i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important to happen .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but conversely , we &apos;ve all done that , or all our creative activities , we can be incredibly famous in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous for the internet to next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video , more than 48 hours of video .
again , there &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times , and it &apos;s like the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> .
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video he had filmed in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was been looked at 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like the video was popular for the first time in the first time .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow in the <unk> .
because you can do that if you &apos;re a high mountain <unk> , you have a lot of time .
he had been uploaded every lot of the <unk> .
and this video was actually sent in january of january , in january of january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video made so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> to us new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
rebecca <unk> , &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , many blogs started to write about it .
michael j. of <unk> science theater was a first one who made a joke with twitter .
and important is that a individual or a group of <unk> took a standpoint with a big audience and accelerated the process .
then this community formed this community of people who shared this big <unk> , and started talking about it and to play with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days there was a parody for every single <unk> .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by us , or something new from it .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> , and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , simple .
this year , it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that was looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video as well .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
important , the creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there were scattered .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot from the ground that made it from a stupid joke that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something , we do with it .
who would have been able to anticipate that ?
who would have &quot; double <unk> &quot; or rebecca <unk> , &quot; <unk> black or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what <unk> did you have to write about , where do you do that ?
in a world where every minute , every minute is up two days of video , only unique and unexpected <unk> like that mentioned video .
i &apos;m not going to give you , i wasn &apos;t interested in a friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who protested in new york against the bikes .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s disabilities that don &apos;t make a properly on the <unk> .
because it was completely surprising and humorous , casey <unk> was a funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and this all leads us to the big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that every access has access to the audience .
as said , one of the largest stars -- justin bieber -- made his beginning to youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we all feel as owners of the owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not making the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still composed of it .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life is burning .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home .
think of it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , how he has to admit that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now , of his mind .
he moved to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories of the time .
my grandmother never had to forget me to his life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to <unk> us , but it &apos;s been through .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> is silent on lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
she had a job for her : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after a four year-old , <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the lake as a <unk> <unk> .
and all of the adults were aware of the risks .
it was the biggest fear of pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little bit of <unk> in front of them .
in a <unk> , my sister and i drink her myself and i drink her grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- that &apos;s all the engine , that clapping of any wave on the bug , the vastness and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that many times came , but from the <unk> of men on our boat , or the <unk> of the engine , or the motors that didn &apos;t want to start for six hours .
no apple ever tasted it again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations that build a new life .
we let us down in <unk> , one from the <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , their existence was completely unknown to me , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , and then on a <unk> in a <unk> , six days , six layers .
it kind of had to find the time to have english and <unk> in the world .
we were poor .
every dollar was given and put in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to give for this , mostly the new things that always came from second hand .
two few <unk> for school , everyone to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here and there &apos;s <unk> : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
after home ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and they heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat of the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake until their <unk> came to her , so i could wake her up .
she opened a <unk> , then got a <unk> , and he opened a business , and he opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looking for them .
centers have been built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one hand , i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of itself .
in the other hand , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence wearing violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many of the years came to help me with this .
and because of this help , i was chosen in my last year of <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was <unk> from a <unk> to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> <unk> , was now tan tan and asked to talk to people in places that you &apos;ve never heard of , and in homes , whose existence you never have to imagine .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the <unk> of the world .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> of this .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was building the boat .
no one has never been a possibility of it .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the open i talked to , the more i should tell you about that .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i could not find myself a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> in the world .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead so easily to collapse the <unk> , so that you accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i went to know enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world is <unk> , but not as you get it .
because possibilities that were not allowed to be explicitly in the way that we have .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange feature of the humility and the <unk> .
so i decided to feel my gut .
i was collecting a little team of people around the <unk> , and i was not a <unk> challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cent of a year .
at the end of every tags , i cook a huge jar of soup that we shared with us .
we worked in the night of the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant of it , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
just a journey there is a journey .
my gut , again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and local mandarin was the most important person in taiwan .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother <unk> her alone .
when she was 17 , she was beaten the second woman to her , whose mother was beaten up .
she was worried about her man &apos;s support for a <unk> , by the way , and she was in her own case , and a more bigger <unk> when she won .
&quot; not &quot; turned out to be <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she was coming to say to say .
my mother called me a few minutes ago .
a few days later , we went to <unk> temple in <unk> and sat in her coffin .
we told their stories and they <unk> that we were still with her .
at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she has been tomorrow for today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t turn them out of it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
if you see who we were and how life has shaped , we can see that the men who might come into our lives have come to our lives .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think in the boat .
who would ever wish one of them ?
yeah , i fear fear , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , courageous every wave , the <unk> , all the engine , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to you , and you could do it , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother today is in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it photography at all ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera , of course .
yet , my interest in photography when i got my first digital digital view at age 15 .
i combined it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera was using the camera in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more about me to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins when the trigger are pushed .
pictures like this : a construction site connected to a lot of <unk> street .
but it has an unexpected twist on it .
and yet , a realistic level of space .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to look like you can always look like it , in a photograph .
pictures that you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick is to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about to capture an idea as a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it around the details or the colors of the color ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion of illusion .
but finally , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality that you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of it .
we have three perfect objects here that we can identify with all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t just make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine by photos .
it &apos;s really just about combine different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , there are no three special pictures of it .
so , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that mutual photos should have the same perspective on the same time .
second , even the same thing should have been the same <unk> .
and these two images meet these two demands -- out of the same altitude , shot the same thing as the same thing .
and thirdly , it &apos;s about to make it impossible , where the individual images start and end up using them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
here &apos;s another example of that .
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of pictures of different places .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to make compromise with the ideas in its head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to figure out the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , fish had been taken on a <unk> of a <unk> .
the waterfront is from a different place .
the <unk> is from a quarry basis .
and yeah , i even have the house up on the island of red , to make it look at swiss .
so to get a realistic result , it &apos;s going to go from planning to planning by planning by planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea of it .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images of the different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of a lot of time .
and then , if you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that we need to do is our imagination .
thank you .
and i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail , you know , a lot of electronic <unk> .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> was to wait a <unk> , right ?
and it &apos;s not a particularly scientific story -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and you ask the patients , families , relatives , relatives , how do it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems , why all -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing to do with it .
she &apos;s got a button on the ground .
and every morning i get to it .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i have my job at the 95 pounds of the time .
it works very simple : every time i jump to the scale , you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to see them from my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and not just in the moment that i have a support or something , but with a look in the past .
there &apos;s something else about it .
maybe you know , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i get to my <unk> , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , because this is the <unk> , because this is the <unk> , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used to smoke , or it could smoke that smoking .
it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play some kind of game , to control their health better .
the next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give you this little <unk> that you have on an iphone or so on .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure from home , for example , to send him to each other , for example , for a 100 dollars for a hundred dollars .
make things easy to use and start with this to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these things , but also through <unk> , you know ?
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around around the <unk> of <unk> .
we know one where all the stations are in gas .
and clear , we can find <unk> in the world .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient &apos;s disease ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next <unk> <unk> was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we built a website and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , in the netherlands , were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps of it .
and we &apos;ve created a <unk> of this .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> , to find this <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone down , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can use your iphone to find the next <unk> that can save life .
and today , we don &apos;t want to take this as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this into a global level of time .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us to help us behave like <unk> to <unk> these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and someone down , it will be your own relationships or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us to teach us the <unk> of these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health , not just to improve the health , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to force us to force ourselves by the environment , which is ...
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take , until it &apos;s charged with it .
now -- we can just skip it -- i &apos;m going to skip the video instead of the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over here ?
okay . thank you .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like geeks .
we choose some fellows , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they really do is show what is possible with technology today .
so you meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
how did he get to look for this particular way of looking for aid ?
we had a team last year of fellows called &quot; code for america &quot; program for america . &quot;
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> in february of february .
and they realized that the city was never <unk> these fire fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , noticed something else , and that was that residents are free the sidewalks , directly before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do good developers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant to adopt a fire hydrant .
you get to <unk> it up when it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take you away from it .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game that &apos;s happening .
this is a modest little app that was happening .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that fellows have written in the last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t make any other <unk> of it .
it &apos;s expanding rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> center of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them out .
and then seattle decided to use the app to use the citizens to clean the citizens of the <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced it to the <unk> , when it &apos;s <unk> , when it &apos;s <unk> .
so we &apos;re familiar with nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it turns out it &apos;s organic , organic , of course , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the software model is a few years in the rule of a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston for three people and two months .
it was about a method with parents who are able to figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
and we was told that if it took over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not anything that &apos;s happening .
there &apos;s a project right now in the northern justice that the taxpayer cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spread from <unk> , is a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important to me .
but more importantly , it &apos;s a new generation that represents a new generation of government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to tackle things in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people around the country that stand up and write up and write every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes of the eyes .
today a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i urge you to do about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally puts their power out of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought it was in the government , is to choose people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s particularly in communities , to be <unk> .
this is the call code for service and information .
they usually come out when you &apos;re in your city , <unk> in your city .
so scott gets this <unk> to this .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and see very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott &apos;s time .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call call in boston .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> , in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- this was in my <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t say whether she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away from that ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott was a man of human beings .
but in &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; everything is public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s digital the physical , the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role in this way .
she connected these two people to this .
and you would have been able to connect them with government performance if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when a neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call it a lot of money , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is that it &apos;s a <unk> .
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and that we pay to be something that is working against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem sexy , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to get to the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it by the way .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizen who wrote a very detailed <unk> report that is an answer to the <unk> about the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to do what we need to do without improving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient in the world .
the good news is that technology is possible to fundamentally make the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build just right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight that fight that we &apos;re all fighting , about who can talk to them .
you can make their opinion , on every channel , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the government problem , you don &apos;t care so much about your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the labor of the government .
and this apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a fire hydrant to <unk> weeds to <unk> a trash trash with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have these fire hydrant all the time , and a lot of people do this .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government that receive taxes and profit .
we are more than that , we are citizens of citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single bit of boring slide , just to show you .
if you could just show the slide to the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form of it .
this slide shows the data of <unk> processors compared to the performance of <unk> processors to the performance of a <unk> area .
and the interesting thing here is that this slide , like some other people we find in our field , are a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency in the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we need this guy on scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happened here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could turn the light on , you could turn it down .
and something else , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper .
now , why do we draw graph in the technology on <unk> curves , right ?
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot of .
now if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would be on the <unk> scale very <unk> , in form of a flat line .
but if something happens like this , this changes the most powerful circumstances in the world .
so if the <unk> was so fast as the <unk> moves , we could get <unk> into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of the <unk> , these kind of <unk> growth , which increase the scale every few years .
the question i want to do is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything for always and forever as fast as well as now as well as a result of it .
there are two ways of that .
either it &apos;s either a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s it in about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something in the way here is going to happen .
that &apos;s really what it means , then that we &apos;re in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask is , and i also often know myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly to keep the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go through that .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year since i &apos;m in this world since i &apos;m in this world .
and i think the reason is that we realize that everything is happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it , right ?
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of making 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
so i want to talk about what that could be , this transition where we &apos;re right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back and look at the thing that look at a longer <unk> , and look at it .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life in the earth .
i think the picture makes sense when you divide it into some <unk> , you know ?
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of it floating chemicals .
so if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re the <unk> .
some of these oil spills contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
and all of those were the ones that were in the <unk> .
these little oil spills were the <unk> in the sense of <unk> .
but these oil vessels were not about alive in today , because every single one of them was a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , that chemicals have <unk> to <unk> chemicals .
so every day , every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which had a greater composition than others and integrated more and more chemicals , and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so these <unk> are going to survive longer , and they increase them in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interesting it will be when these <unk> learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these <unk> have learned the ability to get information , information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and it &apos;s in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found a way of finding evolutionary kind of evolutionary , evolutionary kind of thing that allowed them to be , so that this information could be stored and copied it .
the amazing thing about that is that this kind of information is about the time of 2.5 billion years where they were born , right ?
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s exactly the same letter and the same code , the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can only write , just to write , in this code , in this code .
and i have 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from <unk> .
in it , what i did is i took this code -- the code is made from normal letters that we use to use -- and i &apos;ve written my favorite on a piece of dna , and i wrote 10 ^ 22 times <unk> it .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
would i have been a <unk> , then i would have written it on a virus and <unk> in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna model of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , that things were completely different , which started to communicate these cells and exchange information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
that &apos;s why the expectations of antibiotics grow up to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how to stay from penicillin , and have this information together with other bacteria in dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
this communication allowed now for the reasons of communities , which were in a certain boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all individuals were more than more than the evolution of the community .
now the <unk> is where these communities are so close that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> to write the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years ago .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which are working together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked to be asked by themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop , so that the level of evolution was happening , no longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> that we call organism .
the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> started abstract information , which is the same thing .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures that are <unk> .
so the neurons are the ones that have built these <unk> , which is what they &apos;ve built .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
these gave them an evolutionary advantage to that .
because at this point , an individual -- learning happened now within the time of the lifetime of a single organism instead of this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn for example , to eat a certain fruit because she liked bad , and she made him sick , the last time he ate her .
now this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years to be learned because this information had to be learned from the individuals who died because these fruits were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the <unk> using this particular <unk> , because evolution could now happen within one individual .
it could be done within a time of time .
what happened after that was that individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
and as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
but it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically going to give <unk> notes of me in the hope that a kind of <unk> idea has to create in your head that has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it changes in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism , and that &apos;s what the unified organism is doing .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is , we started abstract .
we go through the same stages that have gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , how we hold data .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to deal with this information .
and it connects us all together to something much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we were now .
so today , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen <unk> little <unk> , where he showed a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again of the world .
the first steps of history that i told you is a billion years of a piece of a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades ago .
the process is feeding itself , and so i think , <unk> is the word for -- if something of its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed from itself .
i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i can use the mechanism that i use to build computers , without the recently , without progress in computing computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them out there .
and it makes it part of ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in last time , is the evolution itself .
and so we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the machine , which is happening .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , a hundred million randomly selected sequences .
now , please all these randomly chosen instructions , bring all the programs , and choose the ones that are the next ones to be the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want to do .
let &apos;s say i want to take numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used to use for this .
so find programs that can be the most famous number of people .
of course , the chance of random instructions is very small that they take numbers , so they don &apos;t get the instructions actually to do this .
but one of them may be lucky two numbers to the right order in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have come on the next one .
store this , <unk> the rest of the time .
now , all the <unk> that are best placed the numbers on the best .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids are <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to the <unk> than others .
say , &quot; please , this process . &quot;
<unk> again .
let &apos;s take a couple of mutations .
and try to get the other generation of the next generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds of milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
and finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i ever could write from hand .
and then when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s irrelevant and strange programs .
but they do the job of it .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because her life depended on whether they did the job right now .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at that . look at that .
there &apos;s , &quot; this airplane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which work together to make their flight safer . &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re going to start to rely on computers for a process that &apos;s very different from classical engineering .
it allows us things to make a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
so , <unk> <unk> us the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes faster .
so it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding from themselves .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , the analog is at the time when a <unk> has developed to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite make what the hell we are here to create .
we &apos;re in the middle of this room .
but i really believe that it comes to us .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all think here are part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
well , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story starts in rajasthan , about two years ago , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel at the time , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
when the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> thirst , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
and we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got a fear of technology .
it was afraid that i could lose the ability to lose the sunset without camera , without camera and tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should do magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver <unk> .
this piece of old technology became the <unk> thing for me to me .
it became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my imagination .
i came up with this as a thought of our send clocks and cameras to dream of it .
they were inspired to be inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them to allow magic instead instead of killing magic .
when i started 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it up .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling always took more sense of this .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , an interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; make your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box is heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character in the book .
and again , a letter to me -- and the ipad knows where i live -- that &apos;s right to gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities in this way .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean my magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i found it quite exciting .
so you have to blow up the ipad , and you have to <unk> fireflies .
and they look at the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s every book and every world , a little <unk> that i &apos;m here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens a map of it .
<unk> had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and <unk> and serves in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is <unk> , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> that are <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children .
a story that counts with new issues like the <unk> of the <unk> .
on the subject of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their pockets , on their computers , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to take a picture of a flower and tag a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> and tag it up .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online online .
a child in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i saw a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today , i saw a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you use the video of the ipads , and reality is an animation from <unk> that appear on a plant before the house .
in one place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology come closer and in the magic and technology and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we get closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me to do that .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the <unk> and in places that there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , and listen to how stimulating this is , i gave me a lot of power .
in the short time , i became a clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise doesn &apos;t have any .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations in the world .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words have meaning a teacher , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother &apos;s disease .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia than slaves to the slaves .
it was born in 1880 , the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving the same way .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
she told me that i could barely breathe . then she would let me go .
one or two hours later , when i came to her , and she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and when i said no , they said to me again . if i said , &quot; yes , she left me in quiet .
she was something that was made that you wanted to be near them .
the only problem was they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins were around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> , and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and that went to me 15 or 20 minutes . she stood up to me , and she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
and she took me out , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to observe you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that way .
and then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; as first , i &apos;m going to love your mom &apos;s always going to love your mom &apos;s day . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you that you &apos;re going to care about them . &quot;
i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; as next , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought my sister home with my sister and me and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> there as else as well .
and he took a drink of beer and offered my sister one , and she took them , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . you just do . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re doing this , we do that , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what your sister had . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you . do you . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well <unk> but what . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still doing you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated by the ground .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that with that .
this is perhaps going to transmit public public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would tell all your grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases of <unk> .
and she believed that these are the issues we have to care about .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> , right ?
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are released on <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
and i think the world is fundamentally changed by the world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in prison , or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles over philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men in prison , in prison , on <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treat much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affects the result of it .
yet , we seem to be very pleased about that .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact line .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few <unk> developments .
my home in alabama , they pull the <unk> if they &apos;re convicted of being convicted .
here in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population lost their <unk> .
we &apos;re <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic <unk> is so high as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that <unk> children to death in prison .
in this country , there are children in this country with children without using <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of time .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question , right ?
we believe , because we taught us that the real question is : has a person deserves to die for one of him to die of him ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question to be .
but you can also think differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : did someone deserve for a crime , but did we deserve it ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been on for innocent <unk> , the <unk> and out of death row .
an amazing <unk> , one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let someone fly with an airplane if for nine airplanes , the <unk> , one crash .
but somehow we &apos;re going to do it by this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question we have right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m my students african-american history , i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that their life shaped .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of the <unk> motivated submission and apartheid .
and yet in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach us the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given a few talks about the death penalty thing about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear you talk like this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death in germany .
and of course , you can never give it in germany . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever have to kill ourselves for the systematic people .
it would be <unk> of us , aware of people and underestimate people &apos;s minds ? &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people <unk> , especially when there were <unk> many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental view of it .
i think our identity is threatened by it .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , these difficult topics are also affected , and then the positive and wonderful things are affected by it .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both of these things .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to a complex world .
for me , it means to create time to think and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the disadvantaged that will never be at ted .
but thinking about a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see from .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so much we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just from our heads of mind .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> that i think they &apos;re driving , not only to be open for all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> things .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said , &quot;
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to be all sorts of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be in <unk> places , and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the most important thing to get into it .
there &apos;s no distinction about technology and design that allows us to be very , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity demands a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t want to do that .
she &apos;s going to touch them .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege , pink parks to meet them .
so these women met , and they were just talking about it .
and then , to called a woman called me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman comes into the city . we want to talk to us .
do you want to listen to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , really like that , &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen to you . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard about it .
it was always inspiring to be the same thing as well .
one day , i was there and i heard these women , and after a few hours turned to me to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the relationship is for the same right right .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
<unk> want to help people be convicted of innocent <unk> .
we want to fight bias and fight discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eradicate <unk> <unk> without a human being for children .
we want to do something about the death penalty system .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that will make you very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman rejected to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> to be a <unk> .
we need to make ways of making these challenges : these problems , that sorry .
because ultimately , our humanity is from our humanity , from our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things about it .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes him that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a predator .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s , there &apos;s a fundamental human would to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s been .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story at the end of it .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m going to tired of how we all do .
sometimes these ideas go ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted to very hard <unk> <unk> .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be as a adult court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
and one night , i stayed too long and thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish that to you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of , i started working on a proposed to work .
i had a <unk> , poor black young boy as a client .
and i started to proposed . the headline said , &quot; according to my poor , <unk> black clients like a privileged , white black clients . &quot;
in my proposed , i explained that error is the <unk> of the <unk> and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country that there &apos;s nothing more important that there &apos;s only error .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i proposed this crazy proposed or actually had written it in fact .
and i didn &apos;t just write him to my horror , but i sent him to the court .
a few months away , and i just had to forget everything .
and finally , i decided my god , i have to put in the dish and this crazy case .
and i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car and went up to the stairs .
when i was the staircase for the dish , black man , the janitors in the court in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he closes me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power to me .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability every single one to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you asked this crazy question ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in the <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors go up and down the janitors .
he always looked through the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and down to it .
and finally , this older black man came with a very modest <unk> in the <unk> and sat right behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , judge the judge quit .
during the pause , a <unk> came in , that the janitors were in the <unk> of the morning .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
i got to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as people as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival is connected to the survival of every single one .
that we need our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and especially , i want to look at those of you who see this , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen this audience , this community of an obvious wish and heard to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s actually about a effort to do a effort , something from the <unk> of punishment that &apos;s flowing in the politics of punishment .
here in california , for example , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars for the death penalty cost of a billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet <unk> percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t end up with a <unk> .
56 percent of the <unk> don &apos;t come to court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something about it .
this <unk> will suggest to invest the money in more <unk> and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere , right ?
during the last three decades , the <unk> is huge in america .
this fact is often asked in a relationship with increased <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not been very changed .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find the <unk> in the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> crusade with drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to prisoner &apos;s dramatic numbers of the prisoner .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric , the <unk> of punishment .
now , we have <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; which brings people to the grid for a <unk> , rather than an theft of good , instead that you forces them to give the victims to the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people , the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current don &apos;t help anyone to be the same thing .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a string to vibrate in here .
they &apos;re a inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is going to bring an increased <unk> to himself , with himself .
famine : famine in somalia . three : spray the police .
4 : malignant <unk> . 5 : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . seven dead .
eight : <unk> 9 : <unk> , <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . weapons of tornado .
recession . war . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just some of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that media prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds are exactly these themes of attention .
and there &apos;s a very good reason to do that .
every second day every day , our senses can ever process much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because none is more important than our survival , the first station for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early detection system , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> the whole information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , demand is very true .
well , with all our digital devices that seven days , it &apos;s not a miracle that &apos;s taken all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century , so strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and energy -- we &apos;ve already got that .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at anticipate problems in a very long way , but ultimately to overcome it .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development of development .
in the last 100 years , average life expectancy has more than doubled the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has a tenth of a sudden .
and it comes to the fact that the <unk> , <unk> , and coordination is a dramatically reduced to the fact that they &apos;re dramatic .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re in a very peaceful time of the <unk> of life .
and according to charles <unk> , 25 percent of them are up by 25 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations of all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line are access to electricity , water , toilets , the refrigerators , tv , mobile phones and cars and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of earth , would never have been able to dream like this .
the basis for a lot of these technologies , and these are growing up to be <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that becomes information technology is going to be great on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less than a million times less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve , which is what &apos;s going on .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it is -- in good ways , war or peace , war or peace , depression and <unk> .
that &apos;s the result of faster computers , the faster computers , the <unk> computers .
it slowed down for none of our big problems .
and despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left , it &apos;s up to the top of it .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everybody .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> supercomputer in the risk of &quot; risk ? &quot;
but that was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human opponents . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that artificial intelligence would be available every owner of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i started here at ted a new university , &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies and services that can be positive within a decade of people who can affect billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would have ridiculous to be ridiculous .
today , we can identify on dozens of companies that have been able to do this .
if i think of it , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about to create a <unk> goods , a half of the time .
so scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example of it .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner with dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> , but was got <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent takes it , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> as a result .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy , all <unk> minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar in india , <unk> rupees -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar solar fell in the last year , 50 percent .
last month , this is published with a study , which shows that to the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , compared to 15 cents a <unk> compared to 15 cents in national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;re going to have water in the abundance of it .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember when carl sagan was the <unk> 1990 when it was saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> of life .
we live on a planet that is 70 percent covered with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , which is <unk> .
it can create a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day -- whether seawater , polluted water , latrine -- and all this for less than two cents per liter .
the director of coca-cola has just <unk> a big <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything is good , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology global in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones from mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just think of that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , when president reagan has 25 years ago , 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the surplus , as nobody could ever have to predict .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you have on and spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what &apos;s expected to be in health care of the world .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> to say , &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize , &quot; <unk> prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a cell phone that you can talk with the device , because it &apos;s ai equipped , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the health , and it prevents a pandemic before it outbreak .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just crossed the <unk> of the world .
and by the way , the largest <unk> against an explosion is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people in 2010 .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to increase two billion <unk> in five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds that we never heard before , will be in global communication .
what do these people need to do ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to do ?
and instead of creating economic growth , i see one of the largest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier through the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be trained by the way , and by the way , they &apos;re going to use 3d printers and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of <unk> us ?
as if it &apos;s a sentence , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are to make a voice to make notice and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring up the way ?
how do it deal with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict the way to predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that little teams who are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things , things that can create great companies and governments only in the past .
and i want to conclude with a story that really excites me about that .
there &apos;s a program that some might know about it .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function of function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors , and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern recognition is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
ladies and gentlemen , what enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to exponential technology of exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what needs .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture that i have to do .
and i think it &apos;s going to start with a medical physicist , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , when i allow it to give me a piece of my own wrong <unk> to allow this to allow me to do this .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball , a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup of the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems soon , and about statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to give you a statistics that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat proposes 300 .
that means that the player is safe from 10 beats , <unk> .
and that means that the ball goes to the <unk> , it &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the first base , it doesn &apos;t have time in time and the hill was in security .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> in a <unk> baseball system ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> of it .
you know how to call a <unk> , right ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams , the last <unk> baseball player -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player took over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less than i &apos;ve talked about about it .
suppose they have a <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> is <unk> .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved people with <unk> , and your <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> that is 200 to 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the <unk> of the <unk> .
and she &apos;s beating a <unk> .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe the <unk> <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be , or doctor or <unk> .
what we do is we put each of them , including me in the world to be perfect to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes it about the details of how to do this .
and this is the message i took in the <unk> of the <unk> .
i was a <unk> student , a <unk> student .
in high school , he said that brian <unk> would learn that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and that &apos;s how it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters of the toronto hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything else .
in my <unk> <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> every branch of each artery , which is <unk> by the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;ve been collecting more and more , more and more .
and i was good , i filled with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew everything known and knew , or at least as much as possible , as possible as i could do immune to the power of mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman , until i met a woman .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto as a woman printer to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
and at this point , i was building the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission when the <unk> was looking for <unk> advice , to study the <unk> .
and give the feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a printer , and she was in <unk> with the <unk> .
and when i listened to her tune , they made <unk> sound .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered under <unk> heart failure .
this is a state where the heart fails , instead of pump all the blood down , put a part of the blood cells in the lung , and you get these gradually , so the <unk> came .
and that was not hard to diagnose in the world .
i asked them , and made me the treatment of treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a year , a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt pretty good about that .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home , i sent them home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on on the right and i did what i should have , which was a call to him with him , so he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew she would have been able to have extra information to her , and he would have been able to <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason , right ?
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to do so successful and so to take his responsibility that i was so , and so i would have to worry about it without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and i sent them home , i <unk> a happy voice in me who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i was so missing that i asked the nurse , who asked the nurse , &quot; believe that it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in <unk> way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember that when it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> came and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on it .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff out , leaving the hospital and went home to go home when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went through the <unk> on my way to home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after ms. printer , but another three words to me and these three words , most of whom i know .
other doctors are afraid that this is also , but the <unk> is very special , because we only see the patients as ephemeral .
the three words , you remember ?
&quot; remember the patients that <unk> them at home ? &quot;
asked the nurse &apos;s nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> , &quot;
so she was back to that .
she was back to die of the world .
about an hour after that she was home after she was sent home , and the family called 911 . the family called 911 . the <unk> took them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she barely breathing and was blue at the same time .
the <unk> moved all the strands .
they gave their <unk> .
they <unk> them to the <unk> of the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> of the world .
and i lived through these rollercoaster , because they came after the <unk> in intensive care , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days realized she would never awakening again .
she had not suffered a <unk> of <unk> .
her family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they found the <unk> of the <unk> .
the day they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you &apos;re saying that you never forget the names of which you &apos;re going to forget about it .
and that was the first time i learned this to myself .
if you do <unk> , and you never do the mistakes of it .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame that we do .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the <unk> of the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that says that not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but that you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt in the world .
and it wasn &apos;t based on my <unk> , he was very happy to be the case of that .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the <unk> and sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
but i asked myself to do these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i do it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , it &apos;s safe to do that .
i started feeling better about it .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i told me maybe i can feel better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working on it .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital north of toronto , north toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of time , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him to it .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember , you know ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> for a minute .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the upper <unk> and causes the <unk> .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt me and went to work and went back to work until again and again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve got two times a little bit of a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of time , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and there were no disabilities in their treatment , and there were no disabilities in their treatment .
i thought he was going to have a <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidney , when this was without <unk> , my colleague in the <unk> of the patient , and she called the <unk> in the lower right sector , and called the <unk> .
the other had a lot of diarrhea .
i went to <unk> him to <unk> him , and asked my colleagues to examine him .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was a <unk> in the right lower sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and they were good at them .
both cases <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , which is many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense is <unk> .
some of my research happened in the last five years .
alone , <unk> and without support for it .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk the silent voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i had a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time from someone who talked about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t get someone talking about your own mistakes .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , a <unk> in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , then you believe i had problems to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who make mistakes and those who are not doing , and the ones that <unk> , who are with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction to the antibodies that attack a people .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we ban those who are hoping to make the mistakes from the medicine , that we will stay a safe system .
but there are two problems in this way .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> in the world .
we &apos;re working in a system that will happen every day , in which one of 10 <unk> is either a wrong or wrong <unk> , and more and more and more , and devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians are dying of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute has taken 100,000 to 100,000 .
both of them are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> of it .
in a <unk> where medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have an cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with the same patient , and then give it a little bit of breath , and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same path .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things in the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are signals that are inevitable .
so if you take the system so i was taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end of the end , no longer left .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and then their pupils , they &apos;ve reached front of the head , they look down and swallow , and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment that <unk> them in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor &apos;s day .
the newly defined doctor is a human , knows to make his humanity , remember , not proud of making mistakes , so everything to learn from them so that it can be passed on .
it shares their experiences with others .
it supports when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a loving , supportive way that all of it benefit from this .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s , then people make mistakes from time to time .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor , the way .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes in the world .
i <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to learn it to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea of it .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was <unk> here .
you may think he <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true of it .
he actually collected the fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
to the &apos; 80s , he was in big style , he was in big style .
it &apos;s now in the red list of endangered species .
this story , we heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally the same thing .
the <unk> still describe than pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , the <unk> <unk> , showing you .
because i found it when i studied a lagoon in <unk> in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself into this .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really mean that .
it was my first <unk> thing .
as you can see , the lagoon was <unk> and from a few mangroves .
there were <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen lived well , they were very good in ghana .
when i came back 27 years later , fish shrunk to half its size .
adults have five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy to be a little bit .
and the fish also had happiness to be there .
so it &apos;s nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my favorite for the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , in the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe is a lot of <unk> .
<unk> meant countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing , this pretty ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
i went to mit , and we took bumps in the southern hemisphere and especially in the <unk> ocean .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now i know it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there , the <unk> , were <unk> .
and basically , the bottom of the ocean was deck and then become thrown out of it .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you take an survey , and then you start with the commercial fishing system .
the reason is changed . out in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals are <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , you threw them away because they were dead .
and once we started with a life .
it wasn &apos;t <unk> yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> every time you go out of fishermen every time they drive in areas that never became .
it &apos;s not going to document the way .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> of the new level , and don &apos;t call us what was there .
if you go to it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the green of their country .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for the people , they were very , of course , of course .
every generation looks at the images that they take in the beginning of their conscious life as standard , and will follow everything of it .
the difference is going to be a loss of loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses to that point .
it can give a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains of remains .
and that &apos;s actually why our goal is largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like they were .
you could now think that the problem was in people who lived when they lived in <unk> societies , and only to a few generations , what they had done .
because obviously an animal that there was very often , only once , before it &apos;s <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of natural animals .
you still lose rare animals .
and so it &apos;s not going to be seen as a big loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and in the ocean that are the big fish .
they &apos;re less , because we start them .
at time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept it .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you can do in an earlier form , are not like you like the evidence to argue .
so , for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a <unk> , which is in this area big <unk> , not used , or by <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific , &quot; because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific &quot; .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role that can play a marine reserve .
because by marine marine whales , we basically put the past to the past .
we imagine the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> have changed and are very low .
so , you can see the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the view that it allows to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the movie might fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was 500 years ago , 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , maybe you remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- except from the <unk> , why were they touched by the <unk> ? why were they touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s lost in a way that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only i &apos;m going to give you , is to cameron , so he &apos;s &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist <unk> , you had to register if you owned a typewriter to the government .
they also had to register a piece of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for that : the government could track , where a text came from .
and found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would limit freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
this is what happens to us .
and nobody doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example where our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens of us .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing existing ones today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from ukraine in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> that their money made through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , and <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
the american intelligence agency <unk> two months ago , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam &apos;s jain , and on this report were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain is on the foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re victims of a <unk> , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s only going to be worse than that .
in the future , most crimes , most crime online .
the second second trait that we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for money because of anonymous , but the last group are nations , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases of <unk> , like the <unk> of <unk> .
it &apos;s what happens when governments attack their own citizens to attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall , it had to sign out , because <unk> was hacked .
someone was hacked , and they had to hack the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior of these group , whether he died for possible that because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in the aftermath of such remote illness ?
<unk> is a <unk> thing .
they sell to <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , if you have a website with a website with <unk> , for example , gmail .
but can you , but if you &apos;re in a foreign course .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the headquarters invented the headquarters in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
this was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a local company in germany that the egyptian government sold a few programs that they could have -- in very big frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are providing <unk> governments with their own citizens to make their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves to help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re almost security of your phone , which is pretty security .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> to collect their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer of people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> citizens .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense of it .
privacy has to be given up .
privacy is not about the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like to trust our governments is every right that we &apos;re going to make forever .
and do we trust , do we trust a blind government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> <unk> were made and <unk> a simple idea : three-dimensional from cement with the set of measurements that fit together .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> in the world .
they put us able to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
basically , the <unk> was going to become the building of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , came out of this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego it made for everybody .
lego , basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , took a building block for our imagination .
in the same year , the next year at the bell labs , the next revolution announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little bit of a <unk> that we could take from a world of static , <unk> blocks into a world where everything would be interactive .
as the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much greater , more complex loop , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was the media lab and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets of magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them out wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly <unk> <unk> .
they put a blue one on a green , and they can make light on it .
you can put a switch in in between , and so you create a little <unk> of it .
take the switch out around a <unk> , and put it here , and they made a little <unk> .
add this <unk> to an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
it &apos;s actually pretty powerful , actually , is quite powerful .
instead of coding , you have to program , or <unk> , to code them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow out , you just get to slow down or slow down , just turn it on this button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a <unk> rock .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread the kids , and we see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , as you start to understand the electronics that they &apos;re in the everyday life , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like a <unk> , or why the doors of the <unk> , or why the doors respond to touch , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
so we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to risd , and they gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my favorite one , right ?
it &apos;s a lobster of play-doh , the fear of darkness .
for this <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material available to all the time .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> download and make it yourself .
we want to the world of creators , the inventors of the contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent .
thank you .
